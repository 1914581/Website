    <h1> Sonnets from 71 to 80</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 71 </h2>
        <blockquote>
No longer mourn for me when I am dead<br>
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell<br>
Give warning to the world that I am fled<br>
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:<br><br>
Nay, if you read this line, remember not<br>
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,<br>
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,<br>
If thinking on me then should make you woe.<br><br>
O! if, I say, you look upon this verse,<br>
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,<br>
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;<br>
But let your love even with my life decay;<br><br>
Lest the wise world should look into your moan,<br>
And mock you with me after I am gone.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When I’m dead don’t mourn for me any longer than you can hear the surly sullen bell telling the world that I’ve fled this vile world to live with the even more vile worms. No, if you read this line, don’t remember the hand that wrote it because I love you so much that I would like you to forget me rather than that, thinking about me, such thoughts would make you sad. Oh, I insist that if you read this poem when I’m, perhaps, mixed with clay, you must not even utter my poor name but let your love die with me in case the world, in its wisdom, should look closely at your mourning and mock you about me once I’ve gone.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 72 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! lest the world should task you to recite<br>
What merit lived in me, that you should love<br>
After my death,–dear love, forget me quite,<br>
For you in me can nothing worthy prove.<br><br>
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<br>
To do more for me than mine own desert,<br>
And hang more praise upon deceased I<br>
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<br><br>
O! lest your true love may seem false in this<br>
That you for love speak well of me untrue,<br>
My name be buried where my body is,<br>
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.<br><br>
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<br>
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, in case the world should challenge you to say what merit there was in me that could make you love me, forget me completely once I’m dead, dear love, because you couldn’t say anything convincing about me unless you could invent some generous lie which would make me sound better than I deserve and attach more praise to my deceased self than the ungenerous truth would. Oh, in case your true love should become false by doing that – as it will if you speak well of me, untruthfully, out of love for me – let my name be buried with my body and not live to bring shame to me nor you. Because I’m ashamed of the things I create, and you should be too, to love such worthless things.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 73 </h2>
        <blockquote>
That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br>
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br>
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br>
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br><br>
In me thou see’st the twilight of such day<br>
As after sunset fadeth in the west;<br>
Which by and by black night doth take away,<br>
Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest.<br><br>
In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire,<br>
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<br>
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,<br>
Consum’d with that which it was nourish’d by.<br><br>
This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,<br>
To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>You may see that time of year in me when few, or no, yellow leaves hang on those branches that shiver in the cold bare ruins of the choir stalls where sweet birds sang so recently. You see, in me, the twilight of a day, after the sun has set in the west, extinguished by the black night that imitates Death, which closes everything in rest. You see in me the glowing embers that are all that is left of the fire of my youth – the deathbed on which youth must inevitably die, consumed by the life that once fed it. This is something you can see, and it gives your love the strength deeply to love that which you have to lose soon.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 74 </h2>
        <blockquote>
But be contented when that fell arrest<br>
Without all bail shall carry me away,<br>
My life hath in this line some interest,<br>
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<br><br>
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review<br>
The very part was consecrate to thee:<br>
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;<br>
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:<br><br>
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<br>
The prey of worms, my body being dead;<br>
The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,<br>
Too base of thee to be remembered.<br><br>
The worth of that is that which it contains,<br>
And that is this, and this with thee remains.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>But be contented when that dreadful arrest takes me away to where there is no bail. My life will continue to some extent in this verse, which will stay with you as a memorial. When you read it again you will be reading again the very thing about me that was dedicated to you. The earth can have only the earth in me, which is what I owe it. My spirit, the better part of me, is yours, which means that you will only have lost the dregs of my life, the food of worms, preying on my dead body, the conquest of the cowardly knife of that wretch, Death, too dire to be remembered by you. The value of that body is only what it contains, and that is this poem, and it will stay with you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 75 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,<br>
Or as sweet-season’d showers are to the ground;<br>
And for the peace of you I hold such strife<br>
As ‘twixt a miser and his wealth is found.<br><br>
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon<br>
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;<br>
Now counting best to be with you alone,<br>
Then better’d that the world may see my pleasure:<br><br>
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,<br>
And by and by clean starved for a look;<br>
Possessing or pursuing no delight<br>
Save what is had, or must from you be took.<br><br>
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,<br>
Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>You are to me what food is to life, or what spring showers are to the earth, and to achieve peace of mind about you I struggle with myself as a miser struggles with his wealth. One moment he proudly enjoys it and the next he’s worried that the thieving age we live in will steal his treasure – now counting it best to keep you to myself, then reckoning it better if the world could see my pleasure. At times I feel full from feasting on your looks but eventually absolutely starving for a glimpse of you, having or looking for no pleasure except what you give me and what I can take from you. That’s why I either waste away with hunger day after day, or either stuff myself with you or go without.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 76 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,<br>
So far from variation or quick change?<br>
Why with the time do I not glance aside<br>
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?<br><br>
Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br>
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br>
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br>
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?<br><br>
O! know sweet love I always write of you,<br>
And you and love are still my argument;<br>
So all my best is dressing old words new,<br>
Spending again what is already spent:<br><br>
For as the sun is daily new and old,<br>
So is my love still telling what is told.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Why is my verse so devoid of new devices – so resistant to variation and novelty? Why don’t I go along with the times and look around at newly adopted techniques and unfamiliar juxtapositions? Why do I write everything the same – always the same, confining all my ideas to their well-known clothes so that every word almost proclaims my name, where it was born and where it’s going to? Oh, you know, sweet love, I always write about you, and you, and love, are always my subject. So all I can do is clothe what I’ve already said in new words, spending again what I’ve already spent. In the same way that the sun is old and new every day, my love is always saying what has already been said.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 77 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;<br>
The vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear,<br>
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.<br><br>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<br>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<br>
Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know<br>
Time’s thievish progress to eternity.<br><br>
Look what thy memory cannot contain,<br>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br>
Those children nursed, deliver’d from thy brain,<br>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br><br>
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<br>
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Your mirror will show you how your beauty is wearing out; your sundial how your precious minutes are wasting away. Blank pages will record your thoughts and you may learn this from your notebook: The wrinkles that your mirror will honestly reveal will remind you of gaping graves: from the stealthy movement of the shade on your dial you will learn about time’s thievish progress to eternity. Write down the thoughts you won’t be able to remember on these blank pages and you will see that those children, nursed and grown-up, will strike you as new acquaintances in time to come. If you do all that it will be of benefit to you and greatly enrich your book.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 78 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,<br>
And found such fair assistance in my verse<br>
As every alien pen hath got my use<br>
And under thee their poesy disperse.<br><br>
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing<br>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,<br>
Have added feathers to the learned’s wing<br>
And given grace a double majesty.<br><br>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<br>
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:<br>
In others’ works thou dost but mend the style,<br>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;<br><br>
But thou art all my art, and dost advance<br>
As high as learning my rude ignorance.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I’ve invoked you as my muse so many times, and found my poetry to be so inspired by you that every other author imitates my style and publishes his poetry in your name. Your eyes, that inspire the dumb to sing, reaching the highest notes, raise the ignorant to soar in intelligence, inspire the educated to fly even higher, have enhanced the graceful’s grace. Even so, you should be most proud of my my poetry because it’s done directly under your influence and inspired by you. With the poetry of the others you merely improve their style, adding lustre to already lustrous verse. But your inspiration is everything to me and raises my great ignorance to high learning.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 79 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<br>
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;<br>
But now my gracious numbers are decay’d,<br>
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.<br><br>
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument<br>
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;<br>
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent<br>
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.<br><br>
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word<br>
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,<br>
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford<br>
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.<br><br>
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,<br>
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When I was the only one who sought inspiration from you it was only my verse that contained the effects of your noble grace, but now my inspired verses have declined as my muse makes room for another. I admit, sweet love, that such a lovely subject deserves the labour of a better writer. But whatever praise of your qualities your new poet makes, all he’s doing is stealing them then giving them back to you. He attributes virtue to you but he only got that word from observing you. He gives you beauty but only discovered beauty by looking at your face. He’s unable to offer any praise other than those things that he’s already found in you. So don’t be grateful for the things he says about you: because you’re paying for everything that he owes you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 80 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! how I faint when I of you do write,<br>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<br>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<br>
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.<br><br>
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,<br>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<br>
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,<br>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<br><br>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<br>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;<br>
Or, being wrack’d, I am a worthless boat,<br>
He of tall building, and of goodly pride:<br><br>
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<br>
The worst was this, my love was my decay.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, how faint I feel when I write about you, knowing that a better poet can claim you as his patron. And in singing your praises he uses all his energy to make me tongue-tied. But since your worth is as wide as the ocean, and the humblest can sail on it as well as the proudest, my insolent boat, far inferior to his, insists on sailing on your vast open sea. Your most shallow favour will keep me afloat while he sails on your deepest favour. But, if I am wrecked it’s because I’m a worthless boat, while he is stately and proud. Then if he prospers and I am cast ashore, the worst aspect of it was this: my love for you was my ruin.</p>
