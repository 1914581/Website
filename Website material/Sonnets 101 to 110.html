    <h1> Sonnets from 101 to 110</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 101 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends<br>
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?<br>
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;<br>
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.<br><br>
Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,<br>
‘Truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed;<br>
Beauty no pencil, beauty’s truth to lay;<br>
But best is best, if never intermixed’?<br><br>
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<br>
Excuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee<br>
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb<br>
And to be praised of ages yet to be.<br><br>
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how<br>
To make him seem, long hence, as he shows now.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh truant Muse, how are you going to make up for neglecting the perfect combination of truth and beauty? Both truth and beauty depend on my beloved, as you also do, and are dignified by that. Come on, answer, Muse. Perhaps you’ll say that truth doesn’t need any ornament, being already attached to beauty; that beauty needs no poet’s pen to advertise it, and that the best things don’t need any help. But are you going to be silent just because my beloved needs no praise? You can’t excuse your silence on those grounds because you have the ability to make him outlive a gilded tomb to be praised by generations yet to come. Then do your job, Muse. I’m showing you how to make him as vivid in the far distant future as he is now.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 102 </h2>
        <blockquote>
My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;<br>
I love not less, though less the show appear;<br>
That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,<br>
The owner’s tongue doth publish every where.<br><br>
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br>
When I was wont to greet it with my lays;<br>
As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,<br>
And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:<br><br>
Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br>
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br>
But that wild music burthens every bough,<br>
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br><br>
Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:<br>
Because I would not dull you with my song.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>My love is stronger, although it appears weaker: I don’t love any less, although I show my love less. Love becomes a product when one widely advertises the strength of his feelings about the one he loves. Our love was new – only in its spring – when I used to celebrate it with my verse, similar to the nightingale singing in the early summer and stopping as the summer progresses. It’s not that the summer is less pleasant now than when the nightingale sang in the silence of the night: it’s more that every branch is full of the wild music of song birds and that when things become common they’re less delightful. And so, like her, I sometimes hold my tongue because I don’t want my poems to appear dull to you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 103 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,<br>
That having such a scope to show her pride,<br>
The argument all bare is of more worth<br>
Than when it hath my added praise beside!<br><br>
O! blame me not, if I no more can write!<br>
Look in your glass, and there appears a face<br>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<br>
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.<br><br>
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,<br>
To mar the subject that before was well?<br>
For to no other pass my verses tend<br>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;<br><br>
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,<br>
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Alas, what poor poetry my muse brings out of me, considering the scope she has to display her skills. The subject can’t be improved on and doesn’t need my added praise! Oh don’t criticise me for not being able to write anymore! Look in your mirror and a face will appear that out-does my poor creative powers, stunting my verses and putting me to shame. Wouldn’t it be a sin if, in trying to improve my subject, I damaged something that was perfectly good before? Because there is nothing my verses aim at other than to count your charms and qualities; and there are many many more to be seen in your mirror, when you look in it, than can be contained in my verse.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 104 </h2>
        <blockquote>
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<br>
For as you were when first your eye I ey’d,<br>
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,<br>
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,<br><br>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn’d,<br>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn’d,<br>
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<br><br>
Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,<br>
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv’d;<br>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<br>
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv’d:<br><br>
For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:<br>
Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>To me, lovely friend, you could never be old, because your beauty seems unchanged from the time I first saw your eyes. Three cold winters have shaken the leaves of three beautiful springs and autumns from the forests as I have watched the seasons pass: The sweet smell of three Aprils have been burned up in three hot Junes since I first saw your youthful beauty, which is still in its prime. Ah! But beauty moves forward continually, imperceptibly, like the hands of a clock. In the same way, your beauty, which seems unchanged to me, moves forward, deceiving my eyes. In consideration of that, listen, you unborn generations: the height of beauty was dead before you were born.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 105 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Let not my love be called idolatry,<br>
Nor my beloved as an idol show,<br>
Since all alike my songs and praises be<br>
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.<br><br>
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<br>
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;<br>
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,<br>
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.<br><br>
Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,<br>
Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words;<br>
And in this change is my invention spent,<br>
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.<br><br>
Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone,<br>
Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Don’t let anyone call my love idolatry nor say that I regard my beloved as an idol because all my songs and praises have been directed to one person and always will be. The one I love is kind today, will be kind tomorrow – forever wonderfully constant. And so, because my verse is confined to something that’s permanently constant, it always expresses the same thing, never varying. All I write about is beauty, kindness and faithfulness. I write about the beautiful, kind and faithful in different variations, and that is how I expend my creativity – three themes in one, offering wonderful scope. Beauty, kindness and faithfulness are often found separately and have never been found in one person until now.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 106 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When in the chronicle of wasted time<br>
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,<br>
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,<br>
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,<br><br>
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,<br>
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,<br>
I see their antique pen would have express’d<br>
Even such a beauty as you master now.<br><br>
So all their praises are but prophecies<br>
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;<br>
And for they looked but with divining eyes,<br>
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:<br><br>
For we, which now behold these present days,<br>
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When I come across descriptions of extremely beautiful people in historical records and the beautiful poems in praise of ladies long dead and lovely knights inspired by them then, in that catalogue of that great beauty – their hands, feet, lips, eyes, foreheads – it strikes me that they are trying to express just the kind of beauty that you have. So all the praise of these writers is only a prophecy of our time, all of it anticipating you. And unless they had had the power of prophesy they wouldn’t have had enough skill to depict your worth. We who live in the present time are able to be overwhelmed by your beauty but don’t have the skill to describe it.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 107 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul<br>
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,<br>
Can yet the lease of my true love control,<br>
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.<br><br>
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,<br>
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;<br>
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,<br>
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br><br>
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,<br>
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,<br>
Since, spite of him, I’ll live in this poor rhyme,<br>
While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes:<br><br>
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,<br>
When tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Neither my own fears nor anyone speculating about what will happen can stop me from being reunited with my beloved, whom everyone assumed was doomed to remain in prison. The mortal moon has suffered an eclipse and the prophets of doom are laughing at their own predictions. Things that were once uncertainties have now come to pass and peace is here to stay. Now, basking in these halcyon times, my beloved looks renewed and death has surrendered to me because in defiance of death I’ll continue to live in this poor poem while he prevails over stupid and illiterate people. And you will find your monument in this poem when tyrants reigns and their brass tombs have disappeared.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 108 </h2>
        <blockquote>
What’s in the brain, that ink may character,<br>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?<br>
What’s new to speak, what now to register,<br>
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?<br><br>
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,<br>
I must each day say o’er the very same;<br>
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<br>
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.<br><br>
So that eternal love in love’s fresh case,<br>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<br>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<br>
But makes antiquity for aye his page;<br><br>
Finding the first conceit of love there bred,<br>
Where time and outward form would show it dead.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>What is there in the imagination that can be captured by ink, that hasn’t served to demonstrate my constant soul to you? What else is there to say – what novelty to create – that may express my love or your worth? There is nothing, sweet boy. And yet, as though I were praying, I have to repeat the same things every day without thinking about how stale they are. You are mine and I am yours, just as on the first occasion I honoured your name. Eternal love, always new, doesn’t care about the decay and rages of age, nor does it take any notice of wrinkles but turns old age into an eternal youth, finding the original source of one’s love there, even though your age and outward appearance would suggest that it’s dead.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 109 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! never say that I was false of heart,<br>
Though absence seem’d my flame to qualify,<br>
As easy might I from my self depart<br>
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:<br><br>
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,<br>
Like him that travels, I return again;<br>
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<br>
So that myself bring water for my stain.<br><br>
Never believe though in my nature reigned,<br>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,<br>
That it could so preposterously be stained,<br>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;<br><br>
For nothing this wide universe I call,<br>
Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, don’t say that I was untrue, even though our being apart made me appear cool. It would be as easy to me to be separated from myself as from you, to whom, if I ever stray, I return, like a traveller coming home; right on time, punctual, not affected by circumstances, so that I am myself bringing the water that will wash away my sin. Even if my nature had every kind of carnal weakness imaginable you shouldn’t believe that it could be so perversely sinful as to abandon all your goodness for worthless women, because I consider the whole universe worthless, apart from you, my rose of youth: you’re my everything in it.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 110 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Alas! ’tis true, I have gone here and there,<br>
And made my self a motley to the view,<br>
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br>
Made old offences of affections new;<br><br>
Most true it is, that I have looked on truth<br>
Askance and strangely; but, by all above,<br>
These blenches gave my heart another youth,<br>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.<br><br>
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:<br>
Mine appetite I never more will grind<br>
On newer proof, to try an older friend,<br>
A god in love, to whom I am confined.<br><br>
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<br>
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Alas, it’s true; I have gone here and there, and made myself look like a fool, allowed my mind to be confused, treated my most valuable things as worthless items and behaved in the same unfaithful way towards new friends, as I did with the old ones. It’s very true that I’ve viewed fidelity disdainfully and strangely. But by everything that’s sacred, these moments have made my heart young again, and these adventures in infidelity have shown me that I love you best. I’ve finished with that now and know that our love will never end. I won’t ever again sharpen my appetite on new relationships, causing unhappiness for an older friend, the god of love, to whom I’m committed. So welcome me, my next best thing to heaven, back into your pure and most loving heart.</p>
