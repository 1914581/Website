    <h1> Sonnets from 91 to 100</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 91 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<br>
Some in their wealth, some in their body’s force,<br>
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;<br>
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;<br><br>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<br>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:<br>
But these particulars are not my measure,<br>
All these I better in one general best.<br><br>
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<br>
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ cost,<br>
Of more delight than hawks and horses be;<br>
And having thee, of all men’s pride I boast:<br><br>
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take<br>
All this away, and me most wretched make.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Some people take pride in their social rank; some in their abilities; some in their wealth; some in their physical strength; some in their clothes – even in ghastly fashions – some in their horses: every disposition has its particular pleasure – a favourite, enjoyed above the rest. But I don’t rate any of those things. I put one above them all. Your love is better than high birth to me; richer than wealth; worth more than expensive clothes; more pleasurable than hawks or horses could ever be. In having you I have something better than anyone can boast of. There’s just one potential source of sorrow in that – that you could take it all away and make me utterly wretched.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 92 </h2>
        <blockquote>
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,<br>
For term of life thou art assured mine;<br>
And life no longer than thy love will stay,<br>
For it depends upon that love of thine.<br><br>
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<br>
When in the least of them my life hath end.<br>
I see a better state to me belongs<br>
Than that which on thy humour doth depend:<br><br>
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<br>
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.<br>
O what a happy title do I find,<br>
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<br><br>
But what’s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?<br>
Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.     
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>But do your worst. Leave me. Be assured you’re mine for life because my life won’t be able to outlive your love for me because it depends on your love. Therefore I don’t have to worry about all the worst things you might do to hurt me because the moment you hurt me in any way I will die. I see now, that I’m better off than I would be if I depended on your kindness to me. Your fickleness can’t upset me since my life would end the moment your mood changed. Oh, what a happy situation I’m in: happy to have your love, happy to die! But what situation is so well blessed that it’s completely without doubts? You may be unfaithful without my knowing it.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 93 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<br>
Like a deceived husband; so love’s face<br>
May still seem love to me, though altered new;<br>
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:<br><br>
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<br>
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.<br>
In many’s looks, the false heart’s history<br>
Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.<br><br>
But heaven in thy creation did decree<br>
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;<br>
Whate’er thy thoughts, or thy heart’s workings be,<br>
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.<br><br>
How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow,<br>
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>So I’ll just go on like that, assuming, like a deceived husband, that you’re faithful. If I do that your face may still seem to show me that you love me, even though you don’t. Your looks will reassure me even though your heart is somewhere else. I would never be able to tell the difference because your eyes could never show hatred. With many people a false heart is shown by a moody expression – frowns and strange wrinkles but when heaven created you it decreed that your face would always express sweet love – that whatever your thoughts or the workings of your heart may be your looks would never show anything but sweetness. Your beauty is much the same as Eve’s apple when your level of sweet virtue doesn’t match your looks.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 94 </h2>
        <blockquote>
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,<br>
That do not do the thing they most do show,<br>
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,<br>
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;<br><br>
They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,<br>
And husband nature’s riches from expense;<br>
They are the lords and owners of their faces,<br>
Others, but stewards of their excellence.<br><br>
The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,<br>
Though to itself, it only live and die,<br>
But if that flower with base infection meet,<br>
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:<br><br>
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<br>
Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>They who have the power to hurt and won’t do it; who seem to be the epitome of some act but won’t commit it, who arouse others to sexual excitement but are themselves like stone-cold, unemotional, and not easily led into temptation – they will rightly inherit heaven’s graces and prevent nature’s treasures from being wasted. They are in possession of themselves; the rest are only managing their beauty for others’ use. The summer flower is lovely when at its peak, although it’s only fulfilling its function of living and dying, but if it falls victim to a serious infection the vilest weed will be better because the sweetest things become the most unattractive as a result of their bad deeds. Rotting lilies smell far worse than weeds.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 95 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame<br>
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,<br>
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!<br>
O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.<br><br>
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,<br>
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,<br>
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;<br>
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.<br><br>
O! what a mansion have those vices got<br>
Which for their habitation chose out thee,<br>
Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot<br>
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!<br><br>
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;<br>
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How sweet and lovely you make the flaw appear that is spoiling your reputation, just as a blight spoils the reputation of a fragrant rose! Oh, with what a sweet exterior you cover over your sins! Those who talk about you, while commenting on your lustful ways, can’t help couching that criticism in the language of praise. Just the mention of your name makes bad actions appear good. Oh what a beautiful house those vices that chose you as their home have – a place where the veil of beauty covers every flaw and everything that’s visible appears beautiful! Be careful, dear heart, of this great privilege: even the hardest knife will lose its edge if abused.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 96 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<br>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<br>
Both grace and faults are lov’d of more and less:<br>
Thou mak’st faults graces that to thee resort.<br><br>
As on the finger of a throned queen<br>
The basest jewel will be well esteem’d,<br>
So are those errors that in thee are seen<br>
To truths translated, and for true things deem’d.<br><br>
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,<br>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br>
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br><br>
But do not so; I love thee in such sort,<br>
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Some say the problem is your youth; some say it’s your lustfulness: some say your charm lies in your youth and playfulness. Everyone, important or less important, loves both your charms and your faults: you turn faults into charms. Just as a worthless ornament will assume value when a queen is wearing it, your visible faults become virtues. How many lambs the fierce wolf could beguile if he could make himself look like a lamb! How many admirers you could lead astray if you employed the full force of your beauty and position! But don’t do that. I love you so much that, because you belong to me, I enjoy a reflected glory from your good reputation.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 97 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How like a winter hath my absence been<br>
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br>
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br>
What old December’s bareness everywhere!<br><br>
And yet this time removed was summer’s time;<br>
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br>
Like widow’d wombs after their lords’ decease:<br><br>
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br>
But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;<br>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br>
And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br><br>
Or, if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,<br>
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How like a winter my separation from you has been, since you provide the pleasure of the short year. What freezing cold and dark days I’ve experienced: it’s all been like dreary December. And yet this period of separation has actually been in summer time and productive autumn, rich with crops, bearing the fruit of a happier time, like a widow giving birth after her husband’s death. But this abundance seemed like a hopeless orphan to me because the summer and its pleasures all depend on you, and when you’re not with me even the birds are silent. If they sing it’s with such a lack of enthusiasm that the leaves grow pale with fear, dreading the closeness of winter.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 98 </h2>
        <blockquote>
From you have I been absent in the spring,<br>
When proud-pied April, dress’d in all his trim,<br>
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,<br>
That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.<br><br>
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell<br>
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,<br>
Could make me any summer’s story tell,<br>
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:<br><br>
Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,<br>
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;<br>
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,<br>
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.<br><br>
Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,<br>
As with your shadow I with these did play.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I have been away from you during the spring when the impressively vivid April, in all its finery, instilled such a feeling of youth in everything that even grave Saturn laughed and leapt with it. Yet neither the birdsong nor the sweet smell of a multitude of different coloured and perfumed flowers could put in a summery mood or make me feel like picking flowers. Nor could I summon up any enthusiasm for the amazing whiteness of the lilies nor praise the deep red of the roses. They were only sweet images of delight drawn in imitation of you, the model for them all. It still felt like winter and with you not here all I did was toy with them as though they were pictures of you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 99 </h2>
        <blockquote>
The forward violet thus did I chide:<br>
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,<br>
If not from my love’s breath? The purple pride<br>
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells<br>
In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dy’d.<br><br>
The lily I condemned for thy hand,<br>
And buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair;<br>
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,<br>
One blushing shame, another white despair;<br><br>
A third, nor red nor white, had stol’n of both,<br>
And to his robbery had annex’d thy breath;<br>
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth<br>
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.<br><br>
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,<br>
But sweet, or colour it had stol’n from thee.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I scolded the presumptuous violet like this: Dear thief, where did you steal your perfume if not from my love’s breath? You’ve very clearly got the deep purple colour of your velvet petals by dying them in my beloved’s blood. I condemned the lily for using the whiteness of your hand and the marjoram buds for stealing your hair. The roses were on tenterhooks, one blushing with shame, the other pale with despair; a third, neither red nor white, had stolen both red and white from your complexion, adding the perfume of your breath to his robbery. But as punishment for his theft a vengeful worm cut him off in his prime. I observed many more flowers but I couldn’t see any that hadn’t stolen its perfume or colour from you.</p>

        <blockquote>
Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long,<br>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br>
Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br><br>
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,<br>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;<br>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem<br>
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<br><br>
Rise, resty Muse, my love’s sweet face survey,<br>
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;<br>
If any, be a satire to decay,<br>
And make time’s spoils despised every where.<br><br>
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,<br>
So thou prevent’st his scythe and crooked knife.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Where are you, Muse, that you’ve forgotten for so long to give me the inspiration to write about the one who gives you all your power? Are you using up your energy on some worthless poem, dimming your power in order to brighten unworthy subjects? Come back, forgetful Muse, and compensate for the wasted time by helping me to write some good verses. Sing to the ear that values your songs and gives you both the skills and the poetic subject. Get up, lazy Muse. Examine my love’s sweet face and see if time has engraved any wrinkles there. If there are any be a satirist, attacking ageing and making everyone despise time’s power to destroy. Give my beloved more fame than time can destroy and so stop his scythe and crooked knife.</p>
