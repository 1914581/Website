    <h1> Sonnets from 51 to 60</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 51 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence<br>
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:<br>
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?<br>
Till I return, of posting is no need.<br><br>
O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br>
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br>
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,<br>
In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br><br>
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace.<br>
Therefore desire, (of perfect’st love being made)<br>
Shall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race;<br>
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade-<br><br>
Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,<br>
Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>This is how my love for you excuses the slow progress of my weary horse as I speed away from you: “Why do I have to hurry there?” There’s no need to race until I’m on my way back. Oh, what excuse will my poor horse have then when even the most extreme speed will seem slow? Then, even if I were riding on the wind, I’d spur. Even in that flying speed I would feel as though I weren’t moving. No horse could keep pace with my desire then. My desire, made of the purest love, will deny that he’s a horse of flesh and blood in his fiery race. But, Love, for the sake of love I’ll excuse my old horse like this: since he deliberately slowed down as I was leaving you, I’ll let him go altogether and run back to you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 52 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,<br>
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,<br>
The which he will not every hour survey,<br>
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.<br><br>
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,<br>
Since, seldom coming in the long year set,<br>
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,<br>
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.<br><br>
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,<br>
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,<br>
To make some special instant special-blest,<br>
By new unfolding his imprison’d pride.<br><br>
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,<br>
Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I am like the rich man whose key can give him access to his locked-up treasure, but who doesn’t want to view it all the time because that would blunt the sharp point that a rare pleasure has. That’s why feast days are so important and so infrequent. Coming so seldom in the space of a long year they are like precious jewels spread out in a crown. That’s what my treasure chest – the time that separates us – is like, or like a wardrobe that hides a suit that makes a special moment even more special when it’s opened to reveal its hidden pride. You are blessed with a worth that allows those who have you to feel triumphant, and those who don’t to be hopeful.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 53 </h2>
        <blockquote>
What is your substance, whereof are you made,<br>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<br>
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,<br>
And you but one, can every shadow lend.<br><br>
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit<br>
Is poorly imitated after you;<br>
On Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set,<br>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:<br><br>
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,<br>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<br>
The other as your bounty doth appear;<br>
And you in every blessed shape we know.<br><br>
In all external grace you have some part,<br>
But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>What is there so special about you, what are you made of, that you can express millions of unusual forms? Everyone else has only one form but you, although just one person, can add something to everyone else’s form. Try and paint Adonis and the forgery is a poor imitation of you. Or capture Helen in all her beauty and it’s you, newly painted in Grecian clothes. Mention the spring and the rich harvest season – the one is just a weak reflection of your beauty and the other a pale imitation of your richness. We recognise you in every beautiful object we see. There’s something of you in every appearance of beauty but you’re not like any of them – and none of them are like you – in the constancy of your heart.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 54 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<br>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.<br>
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.<br><br>
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye<br>
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<br>
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly<br>
When summer’s breath their masked buds discloses:<br><br>
But, for their virtue only is their show,<br>
They live unwoo’d, and unrespected fade;<br>
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;<br>
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:<br><br>
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br>
When that shall vade, my verse distills your truth.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, how much more beautiful beauty appears when accompanied by the lovely ornament of integrity! Roses look beautiful but we see them as even more beautiful because of that wonderful perfume that lives in them. Dog roses have every bit as intense a colour as the perfumed hue of those roses; have the same thorns, and blow as appealingly when the breath of summer opens their buds. But because their appearance is their only virtue they live obscurely and die unnoticed, in loneliness. Sweet roses don’t – the most fragrant odours are distilled from their beautiful corpses. And that’s the case with you, beautiful and lovely youth: when that fades my verse will distill your essence.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 55 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br>
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<br>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br>
Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish time.<br><br>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn<br>
The living record of your memory.<br><br>
‘Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity<br>
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br>
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br><br>
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<br>
You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Neither marble nor the gilded tombs of princes will outlive this powerful poetry, but you will shine more brightly in these pages than those neglected buildings that crumble to dust, besmirched by heartless time. When devastating war overturns statues, and battles uproot buildings, neither the sword of Mars nor the quick-burning fires of war shall destroy this living record of your memory. You will continue on strongly in the face of death and dispassionate enmity,. Praise of you by all the successive generations that will wear this world out will continue until doomsday. So till the Day of Judgment, when you will be raised up, you will live in this poetry and remain in the eyes of the lovers who read this.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 56 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said<br>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<br>
Which but to-day by feeding is allay’d,<br>
To-morrow sharpened in his former might:<br><br>
So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill<br>
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,<br>
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<br>
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.<br><br>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<br>
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new<br>
Come daily to the banks, that when they see<br>
Return of love, more blest may be the view;<br><br>
As call it winter, which being full of care,<br>
Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Sweet Love, renew the strength you once had. Don’t let it be said that your love is blunter than lust, which can be only temporarily allayed by satisfaction and comes back the next day, even stronger and sharper. Be like that, Love. Although you see so much of your love today that you want to shut your eyes with satiety, open them again tomorrow and don’t kill the love you have in you by blunting it. Let this sad separation be like the ocean between two shores, where two newly betrothed lovers come daily to the banks, and when they catch the occasional sight of each other, feel more blessed. Or call this period of separation winter, which being so miserable, makes the beginning of summer, so longed for, so much more special.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 57 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Being your slave what should I do but tend<br>
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?<br>
I have no precious time at all to spend;<br>
Nor services to do, till you require.<br><br>
Nor dare I chide the world without end hour,<br>
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,<br>
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,<br>
When you have bid your servant once adieu;<br><br>
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought<br>
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<br>
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought<br>
Save, where you are, how happy you make those.<br><br>
So true a fool is love, that in your will,<br>
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>As your slave, what else should I do but spend my time waiting to do whatever you want me to? I don’t have any valuable time to spend, or any tasks to do until you need that. Nor do I dare complain about the endless hours as I watch the clock, waiting for you, my sovereign, nor contemplate the bitterness of separation after you’ve said goodbye to your servant. Nor do I dare allow my jealous thoughts to wonder where you may be, or speculate about what you may be up to, but like a forlorn slave, I wait, thinking of nothing except how happy you’re making whoever you are with. Love makes such a fool out of one that he thinks nothing about whatever you do to satisfy your ideas.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 58 </h2>
        <blockquote>
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,<br>
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,<br>
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,<br>
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!<br><br>
O! let me suffer, being at your beck,<br>
The imprison’d absence of your liberty;<br>
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,<br>
Without accusing you of injury.<br><br>
Be where you list, your charter is so strong<br>
That you yourself may privilege your time<br>
To what you will; to you it doth belong<br>
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.<br><br>
I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,<br>
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>May that god who made me your slave in the first place forbid that I should even think about trying to control what you do with your own time or demand that you account to me for it: as your slave, I’m obliged to attend on your leisure. Oh, being at your beck and call, let me bear with patience your liberty to go out and do as you like as I wait here in this prison. And let me cultivate the patience to endure each disappointment without accusing you of hurting me. Go wherever you like, your license is so strong that you can suit yourself as to what you do. You have the right to pardon yourself for any crime you may commit. I have to wait, even though waiting is hell, and not blame you for following your pleasure, whatever it may be – good or bad.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 59 </h2>
        <blockquote>
If there be nothing new, but that which is<br>
Hath been before, how are our brains beguil’d,<br>
Which labouring for invention bear amiss<br>
The second burthen of a former child.<br><br>
Oh that record could with a backward look,<br>
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,<br>
Show me your image in some antique book,<br>
Since mind at first in character was done,<br><br>
That I might see what the old world could say<br>
To this composed wonder of your frame;<br>
Whether we are mended, or where better they,<br>
Or whether revolution be the same.<br><br>
Oh sure I am the wits of former days,<br>
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>If there really is nothing new and everything that exists has always existed then we’re misleading ourselves in struggling to create something new and will always end up, after all that hard work, with imitations of imitations. Oh, that I could look back through the records, even as far as five hundred years, to find a representation of you in some ancient book from the time when human thoughts were first being put down in writing to see what the ancient world had to say about the wonder of your physical appearance. Then I would see whether modern or ancient writers are better, or just the same. Oh I’m sure that the writers of earlier times have given immense praise to worse subjects than you are.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 60 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,<br>
So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br>
Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br><br>
Nativity, once in the main of light,<br>
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,<br>
Crooked eclipses ‘gainst his glory fight,<br>
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<br><br>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<br>
And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,<br>
Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,<br>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br><br>
And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand<br>
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Just as the waves push toward the pebbled shore, our minutes hasten toward their end, each moment replacing the one that went before, straining against each other to move forward in successive effort. Once born, creatures crawl from that pre-birth ocean of light to maturity, facing cruel eclipses that obstruct their glory, and Time, that gives, begins to destroy its own gifts. Time pierces the flowering cast of youth and digs deep lines in beauty’s forehead: feeds on the most exquisite of nature’s specimens, and there’s nothing that its scythe won’t mow. And yet my verses will last to be read by future generations, praising your worth in spite of Time’s cruel hand.</p>
