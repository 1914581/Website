    <h1> Sonnets from 121 to 130</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 121 </h2>
        <blockquote>
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,<br>
When not to be receives reproach of being,<br>
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed<br>
Not by our feeling but by others’ seeing.<br><br>
For why should others’ false adulterate eyes<br>
Give salutation to my sportive blood?<br>
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,<br>
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?<br><br>
No, I am that I am, and they that level<br>
At my abuses reckon up their own;<br>
I may be straight, they they themselves be bevel.<br>
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown,<br><br>
Unless this general evil they maintain:<br>
All men are bad, and in their badness reign.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>It’s better to be vile than to be thought vile when not being so gets the same response as it would if you were, and you don’t even have the pleasure of doing the thing that evokes the criticism from those who think you’re vile, even though you don’t consider yourself to be. For why should others’ hypocritical corruption be allowed to wink knowingly at my lustful tendencies? Or those weaker than I am comment on my weaknesses, presuming to judge what I think is good, bad? No, I am what I am and those who condemn me are only revealing their own corruptness. I may be the straight one and they the ones out of line. You can’t judge my actions in terms of their vile thoughts, unless they’re prepared to maintain this general dictum: all men are bad and thrive in their badness.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 122 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain<br>
Full charactered with lasting memory,<br>
Which shall above that idle rank remain,<br>
Beyond all date, even to eternity:<br><br>
Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart<br>
Have faculty by nature to subsist;<br>
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part<br>
Of thee, thy record never can be missed.<br><br>
That poor retention could not so much hold,<br>
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;<br>
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,<br>
To trust those tables that receive thee more:<br><br>
To keep an adjunct to remember thee<br>
Were to import forgetfulness in me.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>The gift you gave me, a copybook, has already been filled in my imagination – with verses that will stay in my memory far longer than they would in that pathetic book, outlasting any date, for eternity: or at the very least, as long as my brain and heart have the ability to survive. You will be recorded there until each of them has to give you up as they pass into oblivion. That poor book couldn’t hold as much, nor do I need to keep notes to record the deep love I have for you. So I took the liberty of giving it away, trusting to that book that presents you more accurately. Keeping a written record of you would be admitting that I’m forgetful.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 123 </h2>
        <blockquote>
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change<br>
Thy pyramids built up with newer might<br>
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;<br>
They are but dressings of a former sight.<br><br>
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire<br>
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;<br>
And rather make them born to our desire<br>
Than think that we before have heard them told.<br><br>
Thy registers and thee I both defy,<br>
Not wondering at the present nor the past,<br>
For thy records and what we see doth lie,<br>
Made more or less by thy continual haste.<br><br>
This I do vow and this shall ever be;<br>
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>No, Time, you cannot boast that I’m decaying. Your pyramids, recently built, are nothing new to me, nothing remarkable; they’re just new clothes on an old design. We have a short life and so we admire anything old that you care to palm off on us and view them as though we had designed them rather than as the repetition of old sights. I defy both you and the records you keep, and refuse to be in awe of either the present or the past, because history, made in a hurry by your haste, lies. I promise – and this will be for all time – that in spite of you and your scythe, I will show the truth in my verse.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 124 </h2>
        <blockquote>
If my dear love were but the child of state,<br>
It might for Fortune’s bastard be unfathered,<br>
As subject to time’s love or to time’s hate,<br>
Weeds among weeds, or flow’rs with flowers gathered.<br><br>
No, it was builded far from accident;<br>
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls<br>
Under the blow of thralled discontent,<br>
Whereto th’ inviting time our fashion calls.<br><br>
It fears not policy, that heretic,<br>
Which works on leases of short numb’red hours.<br>
But all alone stands hugely politic,<br>
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.<br><br>
To this I witness call the fools of time,<br>
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>If the great love which I have for you had been created simply by circumstances it would be like an illegitimate child – at the mercy of changing circumstances. It would be subject to fashion – what’s in or out at any given time – rejected when seen as weeds and embraced when seen as flowers. No, it was created with more resolve. It’s affected neither by the approval of authority nor by the challenge to authority, which is the current fashion. It isn’t afraid of political plotting, which operates in a short time span, but stands alone – independent, wise and secure – neither growing in sunshine nor drowning in showers. As witness to that I call all those fashion-followers who, after living bad lives, repented on their deathbeds in the hope of transforming that bad into good.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 125 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Were’t ought to me I bore the canopy,<br>
With my extern the outward honouring,<br>
Or laid great bases for eternity,<br>
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?<br><br>
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour<br>
Lose all and more by paying too much rent,<br>
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,<br>
Pitiful tghrivers, in their gazing spent?<br><br>
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,<br>
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,<br>
Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,<br>
But mutual render, only me for thee.<br><br>
Hence, thou suborned informer! A true soul<br>
When most impeached stands least in thy control.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Would it mean anything to me if I were to carry the processional royal canopy, dignifying such shows of power with my presence; or lay the foundations of monuments intended to last for eternity but which in reality endure no longer than it takes them to decay or be destroyed by such things as war? Haven’t I seen those who dwell on outward appearance and the favour of the powerful lose everything and even more than that by putting everything into it, spending all they have on lavish displays instead of enjoying simple pleasures in pursuit of their superficial desires? No, let me be committed only to you. Accept my offer, simple, but freely given, containing nothing but the best, having no ulterior motives, with only mutual exchange – myself for yourself. Go away, you paid spy! When an honest soul is accused you have no power over him.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 126 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy pow’r<br>
Dost hold time’s fickly glass, his sickle hour,<br>
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show’st<br>
Thy lovers withering, as they sweet self grow’st –<br><br>
If nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,<br>
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,<br>
She keeps thee to this purpose: that her skill<br>
May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.<br><br>
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;<br>
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure.<br>
Her audit, though delayed, answered muxt be,<br>
And her quietus is to render thee.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh you, my lovely boy, who have power over time’s changing mirror – power over its ability to harvest all life – who have grown younger as you’ve aged, exposing during that process, how your lover has withered as you’ve become more beautiful. If nature, the ultimate authority over ruin, insists on rescuing you from decay, she’s doing it for this reason: to demonstrate that she is able to disgrace time and kill its wretched measurements. But fear her, oh you favourite of hers. She can slow her treasure’s decay down but she can’t prevent it forever. Even though it may be delayed she has to be accountable eventually. And the way she’ll settle her account will be to deliver you up.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 127 </h2>
        <blockquote>
In the old age black was not counted fair,<br>
Or if it were, it bore not beauty’s name;<br>
But now is black beauty’s successive heir,<br>
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame:<br><br>
For since each hand hath put on Nature’s power,<br>
Fairing the foul with Art’s false borrowed face,<br>
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,<br>
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.<br><br>
Therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black,<br>
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem<br>
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,<br>
Sland’ring creation with a false esteem:<br><br>
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,<br>
That every tongue says beauty should look so.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>In ancient times a dark complexion wasn’t considered beautiful, or if anyone thought so they never said it. But now being dark is legitimately beautiful and it’s become less legitimate to call being fair-skinned beautiful in itself because these days anyone can take on the power that used to belong only to nature, and even unattractive people can make themselves beautiful with makeup. True beauty doesn’t exist anymore, has no special place: it has become devalued, even disgraced. And so, my mistress’ eyes are raven black – well suited to current fashion – seeming to be in mourning for those who are not naturally beautiful but insult nature by making themselves beautiful. But her eyes are so beautiful in their sadness that everyone is saying that that’s how beauty should look.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 128 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How oft when thou, my music, music play’st,<br>
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds<br>
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st<br>
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,<br><br>
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,<br>
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,<br>
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,<br>
At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand!<br><br>
To be so tickled, they would change their state<br>
And situation with those dancing chips,<br>
O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,<br>
Making dead wood more bless’d than living lips.<br><br>
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,<br>
Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How often – when you, my joy, make music on those wooden keys whose movement responds to your sweet fingers, and stuns my ears with the harmony of the strings – do I envy those keys that leap nimbly up and down to kiss the tender palms of your hands while my poor lips, that should be doing the kissing, look on, blushing at the boldness of the keys! To be tickled like that my lips would willingly be transformed into wood and change places with those dancing chips over which your fingers walk with gentle steps, making dead wood more blessed than living lips. Since those cheeky keys are so happy doing this give them your fingers and me your lips to kiss.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 129 </h2>
        <blockquote>
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame<br>
Is lust in action: and till action, lust<br>
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,<br>
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;<br><br>
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;<br>
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,<br>
Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,<br>
On purpose laid to make the taker mad.<br><br>
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;<br>
Had, having, and in quest to have extreme;<br>
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;<br>
Before, a joy proposed; behind a dream.<br><br>
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well<br>
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Squandering vital energy in a wasteland of moral decay is what satisfying one’s lust amounts to. And in the anticipation of it lust makes one dishonest, murderous, violent, blameworthy, savage, extreme, rude and not to be trusted. As soon as its goal has been achieved one despises it. It’s hunted beyond reason and as soon as it’s had it’s hated beyond reason, like an irresistible bait put in front of one on purpose to make the taker mad. One is crazy in the pursuit of sex, and during sex too: having had it, having it and hunting for it one goes to extremes. It’s blissful while it’s happening and a true sorrow afterwards – before an anticipated joy, afterwards nothing but a dream. Everyone knows this very well, yet no-one knows it well enough to avoid the heaven that leads men to this hell.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 130 </h2>
        <blockquote>
My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:<br>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br><br>
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br><br>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound:<br>
I grant I never saw a goddess go,<br>
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:<br><br>
And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,<br>
As any she belied with false compare.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun; coral is far more than her lips are. If snow is white, all I can say is that her breasts are a brownish grey colour. If hairs can be compared with wires then black hairs grow on her head. I know what pink, red and white roses look like but I don’t see any roses in her cheeks. And there’s more pleasure in some perfumes than there is in my mistress’ reeking breath! I love her voice although I know that music is more pleasing to the ear. I admit I’ve never seen a goddess walking; when my mistress walks she treads firmly on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think that my love is as unique as any woman who is the subject of a romantic poem.</p>
