    <h1> Sonnets from 1 to 10</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 1</h2>
        <blockquote>
From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decrease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory: <br><br>
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br><br>            
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,<br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding: <br><br>            
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
      </blockquote>
        <p> <strong>Explanation...</strong>
            We want all beautiful creatures to reproduce themselves so that beauty’s flower will not die out; but as an old man dies in time, he leaves a young heir to carry on his memory. But you, concerned only with your own beautiful eyes, feed the bright light of life with self-regarding fuel, making beauty shallow by your preoccupation with your looks. In this you are your own enemy, being cruel to yourself. You who are the world’s most beautiful ornament and the chief messenger of spring, are burying your gifts within yourself And, dear selfish one, because you decline to reproduce, you are actually wasting that beauty. Take pity on the world or else be the glutton who devours, with the grave, what belongs to the world.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 2 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,<br>
Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br><br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br><br>
How much more praise deserves thy beauty’s use,<br>
If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse’<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br><br>
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.
            </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>
            When forty winters have attacked your brow and wrinkled your beautiful skin, the pride and impressiveness of your youth, so much admired by everyone now, will have become a worthless, tattered weed. Then, when you are asked where your beauty’s gone and what’s happened to all the treasures you had during your youth, you will have to say only within your own eyes, now sunk deep in their sockets, where there is only a shameful confession of greed and self-obsession. How much more praise you would have deserved if you could have answered, ‘This beautiful child of mine shall give an account of my life and show that I made no misuse of my time on earth,’ proving that his beauty, because he is your son, was once yours! This child would be new-made when you are old and you would see your own blood warm when you are cold.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 3 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br><br>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br>
Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br><br>
Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br><br>
But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
Die single and thine image dies with thee.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Look in your mirror and tell the face you see that it’s time it should create another If you do not renew yourself you would be depriving the world, and stop some woman from becoming a mother. For where is the lovely woman whose unploughed womb would not appreciate the way you plow your field? Or who is he foolish enough to love himself so much as to neglect reproducing? You are the mirror of your mother, and she is the mirror of you, and in you, she recalls the lovely April of her youth. In the same way, you will see your youth in your own children, in spite of the wrinkles caused by age. But if you live your life avoiding being remembered you will die single and your image will die with you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 4 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
Upon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?<br>
Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br><br>
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
Profitless unsurer why dost thou use<br>
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br><br>
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br><br>
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
Which used lives th’ executor to be.<br>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Wasteful youth, why do you squander on yourself the riches that you should leave to the world? Nature gives nothing but only makes a loan and, being generous, she lends only to those who are open-hearted. Then, beautiful miser, why do you abuse the generous inheritance given to you to leave to someone else? Unsuccessful money-lender, why do you spend such great sums when you can’t live forever, by thinking of yourself only? You are only cheating yourself, so, when nature calls you away what reasonable account will you be able to give of yourself? Your unused seed will have to be buried with you, which, if used, would live as the administrator of your beauty.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 5 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Those hours that with gentle work did frame<br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br><br>
For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
To hideous winter and confounds him there,<br>
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:<br><br>
Then were not summer’s distillation left<br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<br><br>
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br>
Leese but their show, their substance stills lives sweet.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Time, that so carefully made those beautiful eyes that every other eye gazes at, will become a tyrant to those same lovely eyes and make them ugly; because never-resting time leads summer into hideous winter and destroys it there. Sap is stopped from rising by the frost and the leaves disappear; beauty is covered with snow and all the trees are bare. Then, if summer’s distillation hadn’t been preserved as a prisoner in a glass vial, that summer’s legacy would be lost with that summer’s death. Neither it nor the memory of what it was would remain. But flowers that have been distilled, even though they’ve been destroyed by winter, lose only their outward appearance: their substance lives on sweetly.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 6 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,<br>
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:<br>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,<br>
With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:<br><br>
That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
That’s for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<br><br>
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br>
Then what could death do if thou shoudst depart,<br>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br><br>
Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<br>
To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>So don’t let winter’s ragged hand disfigure that summer in you before your essence is distilled. Fill some vial; enrich some woman’s womb with the treasure of your beauty before it dies. The interest from that would not be illegal lending if it made the willing borrower happy, which would happen if the loan was to breed another of yourself. Or ten times better if the interest were ten for one. Ten of yourself would be better than just one of you, with ten of your children existing, making ten images of you. Then what effect could death have if you should die, leaving you alive after your death? Don’t be obstinate because you are far too beautiful to be the victim of death and have only worms as your heirs.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 7 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Lo in the orient when the gracious light <br>
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty,<br><br>
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br><br>
But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<br>
Like feeble age he reeleth from  the day,<br>
The eye (fore duteous) now converted are<br>
From his low tract and look another way:<br><br>
So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<br>
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Look! In the east when the glorious sun raises his burning head, all men’s eyes pay tribute to his new, fresh appearance, serving his majesty with looks of awe. And having climbed that steep hill to heaven like a strong youth in the prime of life, mortals still worship his beauty as they watch his golden climb into the sky. But when he staggers away, old and feeble, from his highest point with weary horses, the eyes that were dutiful before, now turn away from him and look elsewhere. So you, yourself, declining from your noonday glory, will die disregarded, unless you beget a son.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 8 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?<br>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br>
Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,<br>
Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?<br><br>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
By unions married do offend thine ear,<br>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:<br><br>
 Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<br>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<br>
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br><br>
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
Sings this to thee, “Thou single wilt prove none’.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Why do you, who are music to listen to, listen to music sadly? Sweet things don’t quarrel with sweet things, and joyful things delight in joyful things. Why do you love something that you don’t enjoy, or get pleasure from something that causes you pain? If the true harmony of well-tuned sounds, married to each other in counterpoint, offends your ear, it is gently reprimanding you because by staying single you are denying the part you should play. Remember that one string reverberates with the others to produce rich music, like father and child and happy mother in a family, who all sing together in pleasing harmony. Their instrumental performance is a unity, although made up of many parts, and make this point, in music, to you: ‘Being single you will be nothing'.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 9 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,<br>
That thou consum’st thy self in single life?<br>
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br>
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<br><br>
The world will be thy widow and still weep,<br>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br>
When every private widow well may keep,<br>
By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:<br><br>
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,<br>
And kept unused the user so destroy it:<br><br>
No love toward others in that bosom sits<br>
That no himself such murd’rous shame commits.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Is it because you fear to make a widow grieve, that you waste yourself in bachelorhood? Ah, if you should happen to die childless the world will mourn for you like a bereaved widow. The world will be your widow and weep profusely because you have left no copy of yourself behind, while an ordinary widow is able to keep her husband’s memory fresh by looking at her children. Whatever a money-waster spends just moves from one pocket to another and the world continues to enjoy it, but squandered beauty is lost to the world, and by not using it the user destroys it. There is no love for others in the heart of one who murders himself so shamelessly.</p>

    <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 10 </h2>
        <blockquote>
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any<br>
Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br>
Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br>
but that thou none lov’st is most evident:<br><br>
For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,<br>
That ‘gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,<br>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<br><br>
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<br>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gently love?<br>
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<br>
Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,<br><br>
Make thee another self for love for me,<br>
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Out of a sense of shame you, who are so unwilling to provide for the future, should admit that you don’t love anyone. I grant you, if you like, that you are loved by many, but it’s very clear that you don’t love anyone; because, being someone who doesn’t hesitate to conspire against himself, you are determined to murder your potential progeny. You are prepared to end your noble line, which it should be your main concern to maintain. Oh! Change your mind, so that I can change my opinion of you. Do you, the most beautiful creature, want to be the house where hate lives? Be as gracious and generous to your relatives as you are to everyone else, or at least be generous to yourself. Change your mind for my sake so that you will be a noble person and that your beauty will live on in your descendants.</p>
