    <h1> Sonnets from 151 to 154 </h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 151 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Love is too young to know what conscience is,<br>
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?<br>
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,<br>
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:<br><br>
For, thou betraying me, I do betray<br>
My nobler part to my gross body’s treason;<br>
My soul doth tell my body that he may<br>
Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,<br><br>
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,<br>
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,<br>
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,<br>
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.<br><br>
No want of conscience hold it that I call<br>
Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Cupid is too young to know what sexual desire is; but who doesn’t know that it is first felt with love? So, gentle manager of my heart, don’t dwell on my weakness lest you also prove guilty of it, because your infidelity incites me to be unfaithful to my better self by becoming physically aroused. My soul tells my body that it may be a conqueror in love: the penis doesn’t wait for any further reason, but, rising at the mere mention of you, points at you as the reward of his conquest. Swollen up with the thrill of victory, he is happy to be at your service; to stand to attention when you need him, and then fall beside you. I don’t feel guilty about calling a woman ‘Love’ when for the sake of her love I am always ready to rise and fall.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 152 </h2>
        <blockquote>
In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn,<br>
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,<br>
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,<br>
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.<br><br>
But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,<br>
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;<br>
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee<br>
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,<br><br>
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,<br>
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,<br>
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,<br>
Or made them swear against the thing they see;<br><br>
For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,<br>
To swear against the truth so foul a lie!            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I realise that I’m breaking my promise by loving you; but by swearing that you love me you are breaking two promises: your marriage vow and ,by making a new declaration of love, your promise to hate your new lover. But why am I accusing you of breaking two oaths when I break twenty? I am the bigger liar because all of my vows were made only to abuse you, and I’ve abandoned the truth. For I have sworn great oaths about your great kindness; oaths about your love, your fidelity, and your constancy. And to make you look better I gave my eyes up to blindness or made them see things that they didn’t: because I have sworn that you are beautiful my eye has perjured itself, telling such a foul lie when I have sworn to tell the truth!</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 153 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:<br>
A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,<br>
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep<br>
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;<br><br>
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,<br>
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,<br>
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove<br>
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.<br><br>
But at my mistress’ eye Love’s brand new-fired,<br>
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;<br>
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,<br>
And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,<br><br>
But found no cure, the bath for my help lies<br>
Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress’ eyes.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Cupid set his torch aside and fell asleep. A maid who served Diana took advantage and quickly immersed his love-inducing fire in a cold spring nearby. The spring borrowed heat from this holy fire of love and became an eternal, hot, bubbling bath which men still regard as a universal cure for illness. But, with one look from my mistress, Cupid’s torch flared up again and he tested it by touching my heart with it. Lovesick, I needed the bath to cure me of it so I hurried there, a sad, sick visitor, but I found no cure: the bath was of no help – the only thing that could work was the one thing that gave Cupid his new fire – a glance from my mistress’s eye.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 154 </h2>
        <blockquote>
The little Love-god lying once asleep,<br>
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,<br>
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep<br>
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand<br><br>
The fairest votary took up that fire<br>
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed;<br>
And so the General of hot desire<br>
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.<br>
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,<br><br>
Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,<br>
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,<br>
For men diseased; but I, my mistress’ thrall,<br><br>
Came there for cure and this by that I prove,<br>
Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>One day the little love god was asleep, having put his heart-inflaming torch down, while several of Diana’s maids, who had all taken vows of lifelong chastity, were tripping by. The most beautiful votary lifted the torch that had warmed the hearts of legions of true lovers. And so, the general of hot desire was disarmed while sleeping. The maid quenched the torch in a nearby cool spring and the spring took eternal heat from this fire of love and became a hot bath full of healthful qualities. But when I, entirely captivated by my mistress, went there to be cured, this is what I found: the fire of love heats water but water doesn’t cool love down.</p>
