    <h1> Sonnets from 41 to 50</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 41 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,<br>
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,<br>
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,<br>
For still temptation follows where thou art.<br><br>
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,<br>
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail’d;<br>
And when a woman woos, what woman’s son<br>
Will sourly leave her till he have prevail’d?<br><br>
Ay me! but yet thou might’st my seat forbear,<br>
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,<br>
Who lead thee in their riot even there<br>
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:–<br><br>
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,<br>
Thine by thy beauty being false to me.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Those innocent infidelities that your independence allows you to commit when you occasionally forget about me are normal for someone with your youthfulness and beauty because temptation follows you wherever you go. You’re noble and therefore regarded as someone to be won. You’re beautiful and therefore to be pursued. And when a woman is the wooer what man would rudely refuse her till he has had his way with her? But dear me, you might resist when it comes to my mistress, and keep your beauty and youthful wantonness in check: they’re leading you into a lack of control that makes you break a double bond – hers by being tempted by your beauty, and yours, where your beauty makes you false to me.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 42 </h2>
        <blockquote>
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,<br>
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;<br>
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,<br>
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.<br><br>
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:<br>
Thou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her;<br>
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<br>
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.<br><br>
If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,<br>
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;<br>
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<br>
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:<br><br>
But here’s the joy; my friend and I are one;<br>
Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>That you have her isn’t the only thing that’s upsetting me, although I can tell you I loved her dearly. That she has you is the main reason that I’m crying – a loss of love that hurts me more. This is how I’ll make excuses for you two offenders in love: You love her because you know I love her. And in the same way, she abuses me for my own sake, putting up with my friend making love to her because she knows I love him. If I lose you my loss is my mistress’ gain. And in losing her my friend is gaining. You both gain each other and I lose both of you. And both lay this burden on me for my own sake. But here’s the happy part: my friend and I are one person. What flattery! So she loves only me!</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 43 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,<br>
For all the day they view things unrespected;<br>
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<br>
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.<br><br>
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,<br>
How would thy shadow’s form form happy show<br>
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br>
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<br><br>
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made<br>
By looking on thee in the living day,<br>
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<br>
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<br><br>
All days are nights to see till I see thee,<br>
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>It’s when I’m most soundly asleep that my eyes best see because all day long they are looking at things that aren’t significant; but when I’m asleep they see you in dreams and glitter brightly, directed to your bright image in the dark. So how would you, whose very shadow brightens the dark, appear in daylight with your even brighter light, when your shadow shines so brightly to unseeing eyes? How would my eyes be blessed by seeing you in the full daylight when they already look at your beautiful image when sleep lies heavy upon them? Every day is a dark night until I’m able to see you and the nights are bright days when I see you in my dreams.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 44 </h2>
        <blockquote>
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<br>
Injurious distance should not stop my way;<br>
For then despite of space I would be brought,<br>
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.<br><br>
No matter then although my foot did stand<br>
Upon the farthest earth remov’d from thee;<br>
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,<br>
As soon as think the place where he would be.<br><br>
But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,<br>
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<br>
But that so much of earth and water wrought,<br>
I must attend time’s leisure with my moan;<br><br>
Receiving nought by elements so slow<br>
But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought instead of flesh, this destructive distance between us wouldn’t be a barrier because then, no matter how far away they were, I would come from the most remote regions to where you are. It wouldn’t matter, then, that my feet were planted on the furthest place on earth from you: nimble thought can jump over both land and sea as quickly as it can think of the place where it wants to be. But, ah, it’s killing me that I’m not made of thought, to leap over the many miles when you are gone but, being made of so much earth and water, I must fill the long hours without you with my complaint. I get nothing from such slow elements, except heavy tears, the mark of both elements.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 45 </h2>
        <blockquote>
The other two, slight air, and purging fire<br>
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;<br>
The first my thought, the other my desire,<br>
These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br><br>
For when these quicker elements are gone<br>
In tender embassy of love to thee,<br>
My life, being made of four, with two alone<br>
Sinks down to death, oppress’d with melancholy;<br><br>
Until life’s composition be recured<br>
By those swift messengers return’d from thee,<br>
Who even but now come back again, assured<br>
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:<br><br>
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,<br>
I send them back again, and straight grow sad.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>The other two elements, light air and purging fire, are with you, wherever I may be. The first is my thought, the other my desire. They slide easily between us. When those faster elements are away on a loving mission to you my life, which is made of four, left with only two, sinks downwards to death with depression until it’s revived by the return from you of those swift messengers. Even now, making sure that you’re in good health, they’ve just returned to tell me that. Hearing that I rejoice but then I become sad once more and send them back again and immediately fall into a depression.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 46 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,<br>
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;<br>
Mine eye my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,<br>
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.<br><br>
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,<br>
A closet never pierc’d with crystal eyes,<br>
But the defendant doth that plea deny,<br>
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<br><br>
To ‘cide this title is impannelled<br>
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;<br>
And by their verdict is determined<br>
The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part:<br><br>
As thus: mine eye’s due is thine outward part,<br>
And my heart’s right, thine inward love of heart.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>My eye and heart are at deadly war with each other over which one will have control of your image. My eye wants to bar my heart from the sight of the picture it has of you; my heart wants to deny my eye the right to the image it has of you. My heart insists that the true picture of you lies locked inside of him, never penetrated by eyes, that can reveal it. But the defendant denies that charge and claims that your beauty lies in him. To decide this case a jury of my thoughts has been assembled, all of them holding allegiance to the heart. And their verdict on which portion of your image belongs to the eye and which to the heart is: my eye is awarded your outward part and my heart has the right to the inward love of your heart.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 47 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br>
And each doth good turns now unto the other:<br>
When that mine eye is famish’d for a look,<br>
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,<br><br>
With my love’s picture then my eye doth feast,<br>
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;<br>
Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest,<br>
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:<br><br>
So, either by thy picture or my love,<br>
Thy self away, art present still with me;<br>
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br>
And I am still with them, and they with thee;<br><br>
Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<br>
Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eyes’ delight.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>An agreement has been reached between my eye and my heart and each one is doing the other favours now. When my eye is starving for a glimpse of you or my heart is busy smothering himself sighing for you then my eye feasts on a picture of you and invites my heart to the painted banquet. Another time my eye is my heart’s guest and shares some of his thoughts of love. So either by your picture or my thoughts of love you are always with me even though you’re not here. You can’t travel further than my thoughts and I am always with them and they are always with you. If they go to sleep, as long as your picture is within sight my heart will wake and it will delight both heart and eye.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 48 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How careful was I when I took my way,<br>
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,<br>
That to my use it might unused stay<br>
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!<br><br>
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,<br>
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,<br>
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,<br>
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.<br><br>
Thee have I not lock’d up in any chest,<br>
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,<br>
Within the gentle closure of my breast,<br>
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;<br><br>
And even thence thou wilt be stol’n I fear,<br>
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How careful I used to be when I went travelling, to put even the most trivial of my possessions behind the most secure locks available to keep them from the hands of thieves. But you – my best comfort – compared with whom my jewels are no more than trifles, have become my greatest worry, you dearest of dears who means everything to me, because you’re left open to every vulgar thief. I haven’t locked you up in any chest, except the one where you are not – although I feel you are – inside the tender enclosure of my breast, from where you may come and go as you please. And I’m afraid that you’ll be stolen even from there because even honest men would become thieves to get a prize so rich.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 49 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Against that time, if ever that time come,<br>
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,<br>
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,<br>
Called to that audit by advis’d respects;<br><br>
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,<br>
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,<br>
When love, converted from the thing it was,<br>
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;<br><br>
Against that time do I ensconce me here,<br>
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,<br>
And this my hand, against my self uprear,<br>
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:<br><br>
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,<br>
Since why to love I can allege no cause.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Anticipating that time, if that time ever comes, when I will see you frowning at my defects; when after serious consideration, your love for me has outlived itself – anticipating that time when you will walk past me as you would a stranger, hardly even glancing at me with that sun-like eye; when that love has changed to something else, informed, now, by serious judgment – anticipating that time, I’m ensconcing myself here, in the full knowledge of what I deserve, testifying against myself to defend the arguments in your favour. All the arguments for leaving me are on your side since I can offer none for your loving me.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 50 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How heavy do I journey on the way,<br>
When what I seek, my weary travel’s end,<br>
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,<br>
‘Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!’<br><br>
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br>
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br>
As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br>
His rider lov’d not speed being made from thee.<br><br>
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br>
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br>
Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br>
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;<br><br>
For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br>
My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How heavy my heart is as I travel because my goal – the weary destination – will provide, in its leisurely and relaxed state, the chance to think “I’m so many miles away from my friend.” The horse that’s carrying me, wearied by my sadness, plods heavily on, bearing the weight of my feelings as though the wretch knows by some instinct that his rider is reluctant to speed because he’s moving away from you. The blood-drawing spurs that I sometimes thrust into his hide in anger can’t make him go any faster. All he does is respond with a heavy groan that hurts me more than the spurs in his sides hurt him because it reminds me that my grief lies ahead and my joy is all behind.</p>
