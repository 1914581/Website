    <h1> Sonnets from 21 to 30</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 21 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So is it not with me as with that Muse,<br>
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,<br>
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<br>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br><br>
Making a couplement of proud compare<br>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems,<br>
With April’s first-born flowers, and all things rare,<br>
That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.<br><br>
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,<br>
And then believe me, my love is as fair<br>
As any mother’s child, though not so bright<br>
As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:<br><br>
Let them say more that like of hearsay well;<br>
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I am not like that poet who uses artificial comparisons, even images of heaven itself, to enhance his descriptions of his loved one, tediously likening every beautiful object to his love, in exaggerated comparisons with the sun and the moon, the fresh spring flowers, and all those wonderful things that reflect heaven on earth. Oh, let me be truthful in love but match that with truth in my poems. Believe me, then, my love is as beautiful as anyone else, although not as bright as the stars. Let those who love gossip say, if they want to, that I won’t praise something that I have no intention of selling.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 22 </h2>
        <blockquote>
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br>
So long as youth and thou are of one date;<br>
But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,<br>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<br><br>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<br>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br><br>
O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary<br>
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<br>
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<br>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br><br>
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<br>
Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>As long as you appear eternally young my mirror will not persuade me that I am old. But when I begin to see wrinkles on your brow then it will be time to anticipate my death. All that beauty that covers you is only the fine clothing of this heart of mine that lives in your heart, as yours lives in mine. How can I then be older than you? Oh, therefore, love, you should take as good care of yourself as I take care, not of myself, but of you, because your heart is in me and I will take care of it as a loving nurse protects her baby from harm. Don’t presume that your heart will survive when mine is dead; you gave me yours, never to be given back.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 23 </h2>
        <blockquote>
As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br>
Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br>
Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;<br><br>
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say<br>
The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,<br>
And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,<br>
O’ercharg’d with burthen of mine own love’s might.<br><br>
O! let my books be then the eloquence<br>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br>
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br>
More than that tongue that more hath more express’d.<br><br>
O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:<br>
To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Like an unrehearsed actor on the stage, who forgets his lines because of nervousness, or some angry animal overwhelmed with rage so that in spite of its strength it is weakened by its loss of control, I, not trusting myself, am unable to articulate the love I feel, and the strength of my love seems to be less than it is, overloaded with the weight of my beloved’s dominating power. Oh, let my writings then be the speakers and the signals of my speaking heart, that beg for love and hopes for reciprocation, more eloquent than that tongue that more usually expresses the heart. Oh, learn to read the volumes that my silent love has written. To hear with eyes is something characteristic of lovers.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 24 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Mine eye hath play’d the painter and hath steel’d,<br>
Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart;<br>
My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,<br>
And perspective it is best painter’s art.<br><br>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br>
To find where your true image pictur’d lies,<br>
Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,<br>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<br><br>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<br>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br><br>
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br>
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>My eye has taken the role of the artist and engraved an image of your beauty on my heart. My body is the frame that surrounds it, setting its proportions in that space. It is through the painter that one may see how art depicts nature, and where the best image of anything is, and yours hangs in the studio of my heart, which has your eyes as its windows, forever. Now see what a good turn your eyes and mine have done each other. My eyes have drawn your form and yours are the windows of my heart, through which the sun loves to peep, to look at you in there. But eyes lack the artistry to show what lies within the heart; they draw only what they see and cannot know what’s in the heart.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 25 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Let those who are in favour with their stars<br>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br>
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars<br>
Unlook’d for joy in that I honour most.<br><br>
Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread<br>
But as the marigold at the sun’s eye,<br>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br><br>
After a thousand victories once foiled,<br>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br>
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<br><br>
Then happy I, that love and am beloved,<br>
Where I may not remove nor be removed.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Let those who have achieved success enjoy the glory of high office and aristocratic titles, while I, who have been barred by fortune from such triumph, take quiet delight in that which I most value. The favourites of great princes enjoy brief days of sunshine, as marigolds do for as long as the sun shines directly on them, their glory being confined to that moment, because it dies at a frown from the prince. The soldier, made famous for his military prowess, is stripped of his honour once he has been defeated, even after a thousand victories, and everything he strove for is forgotten. But I, who love and am loved, am fortunate in that I can’t remove myself from that state or be removed from it by anyone else.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 26 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<br>
To thee I send this written embassage,<br>
To witness duty, not to show my wit:<br><br>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<br>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br>
In thy soul’s thought, all naked, will bestow it:<br><br>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br>
And puts apparel on my tottered loving,<br>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<br><br>
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<br>
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Lord of my love, whose merit has ensured that I will serve you loyally, I send this written message to you to demonstrate my devotion, not my intellectual skills – devotion so vast that my skill seems bare and meaningless by comparison, because I can’t find the words to express it. I nevertheless retain the hope that some imaginative inspiration deep in your heart will bestow some meaning on my completely bare love. Only when whichever star that guides my actions looks on me with a benign and gracious blessing, and puts clothes on my ragged love so that I will appear worthy of your respect, will I dare to proclaim my love for you. Until then I dare not reveal myself for you to put it to the test.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 27 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br>
But then begins a journey in my head<br>
To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:<br><br>
For then my thoughts–from far where I abide–<br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br><br>
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br>
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<br><br>
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Weary from travelling, I hasten to my bed – that welcome place of rest for limbs tired out from travel. But then another journey begins in my head that puts my mind to work after my body’s work has ended; because my mind begins another, arduous, trip, from far away from home, to where you are, keeping my drooping eyelids wide open. It makes them stare at darkness, as blind people do, except that my imagination makes me see your image, that hangs like a jewel in the black night and makes it beautiful, transforming its old face to a young one. Look, now! Because of you, neither my limbs by day, nor my mind by night, enjoy any rest.</p>
            
        <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 28 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How can I then return in happy plight,<br>
That am debarred the benefit of rest?<br>
When day’s oppression is not eas’d by night,<br>
But day by night and night by day oppress’d,<br><br>
And each, though enemies to either’s reign,<br>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,<br>
The one by toil, the other to complain<br>
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.<br><br>
I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,<br>
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<br>
So flatter I the swart-complexion’d night,<br>
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.<br><br>
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,<br>
And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>So how can I, who am prevented from the benefit of rest, return in a contented frame of mind when the oppression of the day isn’t relieved at night, but the day is oppressed by the night and the night oppressed by the day? And although they are natural enemies they shake hands on an agreement to torture me, the one with travel, the other to dwell on thoughts of how far away from you I have travelled. To please the day I tell him that your brightness lights him up when clouds conceal the sky, and I flatter the black-complexioned night that you brighten the evening sky when the sparkling stars are not shining. But day prolongs my sorrows daily, and night makes my grief grow stronger nightly.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 29 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes<br>
I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br><br>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br>
Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,<br>
With what I most enjoy contented least;<br><br>
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br>
Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;<br><br>
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br>
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When my luck has failed and no-one gives me any sympathy, I sit all alone and cry about being an outcast, and bother the deaf ears of heaven with my useless cries; and examine myself and curse my fate, wishing that I was like someone with good prospects; or that I looked like another, or had friends like yet another, coveting this man’s skill, and that man’s range – totally dissatisfied with the things I usually enjoy. Yet, as I’m thinking these thoughts, almost believing myself despicable, I think of you by chance and then my soul, like the lark rising from the glum earth at daybreak, sings hymns at heaven’s gate. Because when I remember your sweet love, the thought brings such wealth that I’d then refuse to change places with kings.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 30 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought<br>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:<br><br>
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<br>
For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,<br>
And weep afresh love’s long since cancell’d woe,<br>
And moan the expense of many a vanish’d sight:<br><br>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er<br>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br><br>
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br>
All losses are restor’d and sorrows end.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When I summons the remembrance of past things to the court of sweet silent thought I regret not having achieved many of the things I strived for, and I add new tears to the old griefs, crying about the waste of my valuable time. It is then that I can drown my eyes, which don’t often flow, thinking about precious friends who are dead; and weep all over again for love that has lost its pain long ago; and cry over many a sight I’ll never see again. At those times I’m able to cry over sorrows I’ve long ago let go of, and sadly count them one by one, and feel them all over again, as though I hadn’t suffered their pain before. But if, while doing that, I think about you, my dear friend, all those losses are restored and my pain ends.</p>
