    <h1> Sonnets from 61 to 70</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 61 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open<br>
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?<br>
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,<br>
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?<br><br>
Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee<br>
So far from home into my deeds to pry,<br>
To find out shames and idle hours in me,<br>
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?<br><br>
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:<br>
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:<br>
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,<br>
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:<br><br>
For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,<br>
From me far off, with others all too near.    
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Is this what you want – that the mental picture of you should keep my heavy eyelids open all through the weary night? Do you want my sleep to be interrupted by tantalizing images of you? Are you sending your spirit so far from home to pry into my affairs, to find out the shameful things I’ve been up to in my idle hours? Is that the extent and nature of your jealously? Oh no, although your love for me is great, it’s not that great! It’s my great love that confounds my sleep, constantly concerned about you. I watch over you while you are awake somewhere else, far away from me, while certain others are all too near to you!</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 62 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye<br>
And all my soul, and all my every part;<br>
And for this sin there is no remedy,<br>
It is so grounded inward in my heart.<br><br>
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,<br>
No shape so true, no truth of such account;<br>
And for myself mine own worth do define,<br>
As I all other in all worths surmount.<br><br>
But when my glass shows me myself indeed<br>
Beated and chopp’d with tanned antiquity,<br>
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;<br>
Self so self-loving were iniquity.<br><br>
‘Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,<br>
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>The sin of self-love conditions everything I see, and my entire soul, and every one of my faculties. And there’s no remedy for this sin, it’s so deeply rooted in my heart. I keep thinking that no-one’s face is as gracious as mine is; nobody as well-proportioned; no-one’s integrity as sound. I regard myself as surpassing everyone else in everything. But when my mirror shows me what I’m really like – beaten and creased by ageing and the sun – I conclude the exact opposite to what my self-love tells me. To love myself so much would be a disgrace. It’s you, my self, that I’m really praising when I praise myself, giving my old age the beauty of your youth.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 63 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Against my love shall be as I am now,<br>
With Time’s injurious hand crush’d and o’erworn;<br>
When hours have drain’d his blood and fill’d his brow<br>
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn<br><br>
Hath travell’d on to age’s steepy night;<br>
And all those beauties whereof now he’s king<br>
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,<br>
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;<br><br>
For such a time do I now fortify<br>
Against confounding age’s cruel knife,<br>
That he shall never cut from memory<br>
My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life:<br><br>
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,<br>
And they shall live, and he in them still green.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>In anticipation of the time when my love will be as I am now, crushed and worn out by time’s destroying hand; when the years will have sapped his energy and covered his forehead with wrinkles; when the morning of his youth will have journeyed on to the hard night of old age, and all the beauty which crowns him now will be disappearing or have completely disappeared, stealing the treasures of his youth – I’m preparing myself for that time, defending myself against the cruel knife of damaging old age to make sure that he will never cut the beauty of my sweet love from my memory, even if he should die. His beauty will be seen in these black verses, which will survive, and he will live in them, forever young.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 64 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defac’d<br>
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;<br>
When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz’d,<br>
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;<br><br>
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<br>
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<br>
And the firm soil win of the watery main,<br>
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;<br><br>
When I have seen such interchange of state,<br>
Or state itself confounded to decay;<br>
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate<br>
That Time will come and take my love away.<br><br>
This thought is as a death which cannot choose<br>
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Having seen the glorious monuments of ages past – built by men now dead and buried – defaced by time’s terrible hand; having seen once high towers torn down, and hard brass destroyed by human anger; having seen the hungry ocean flood the shore and firm land fill parts of the sea, each one gaining and losing; having seen the way things change their nature, or even that very nature forced into decay, all that destruction has taught me to think this: that Time will come and take my love away. This thought is like death and I can’t do anything but weep about having something that I’m so afraid of losing.</p>
            
                    <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 65 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br>
But sad mortality o’ersways their power,<br>
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br>
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<br><br>
O! how shall summer’s honey breath hold out,<br>
Against the wrackful siege of battering days,<br>
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,<br>
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?<br><br>
O fearful meditation! where, alack,<br>
Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?<br>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?<br>
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<br><br>
O! none, unless this miracle have might,<br>
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Since neither brass nor stone nor earth nor the limitless ocean can resist the power of mortality, how could beauty have a chance of resisting its force when beauty’s power is no stronger than that of a flower? Oh, how could the sweet-smelling breath of summer hold out against the fierce attack of war-like time when invulnerable rocks are not strong enough, nor steel gates firm enough, to resist its decaying force? Oh, terrifying thought! Where, oh where could time’s finest jewel be hidden from time itself? Or what strong hand could slow time down? Or who is there to forbid its destruction of your beauty? Oh, no-one unless this miracle should happen: that the one I love will continue to shine brightly in black ink.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 66 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,<br>
As to behold desert a beggar born,<br>
And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,<br>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br><br>
And gilded honour shamefully misplac’d,<br>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br>
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac’d,<br>
And strength by limping sway disabled<br><br>
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br>
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,<br>
And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,<br>
And captive good attending captain ill:<br><br>
Tir’d with all these, from these would I be gone,<br>
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Exhausted with the following things I cry out for releasing death: for example, seeing a deserving person who has been born into poverty; and an undeserving one dressed in the finest clothes; and someone who shows trustworthiness wretchedly betrayed; and public honour shamefully bestowed on the unfit; and unblemished goodness forced into bad ways; and genuine perfection unjustly disgraced; and conviction crippled by corruption; and skill suppressed by those with the power to do it; and stupidity restraining the advance of knowledge; and simple truth being dismissed as simplistic; and good taking orders from evil. Exhausted with all these things I want to escape, except that by dying I would be abandoning my love.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 67 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,<br>
And with his presence grace impiety,<br>
That sin by him advantage should achieve,<br>
And lace itself with his society?<br><br>
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,<br>
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?<br>
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek<br>
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?<br><br>
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,<br>
Beggar’d of blood to blush through lively veins?<br>
For she hath no exchequer now but his,<br>
And proud of many, lives upon his gains.<br><br>
O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had.<br>
In days long since, before these last so bad.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Ah, why should he have to be surrounded by corruption, gracing sinners with his presence, only to be taken advantage of by them? Why should shallow paintings be allowed to imitate his features, resulting in lifeless copies of his vital beauty? Why should the less beautiful be falsely represented as roses when he is a true rose? What’s the purpose of his being alive now that Nature has become bankrupt, unable to produce enough of the blood needed to imbue human beings with life and colour? It’s because he is the only treasure in her bank and, having so many children to support, she depends on that. Oh, she hoards him to show what wealth she had in times past, before these recent hard times.</p>
            
                    <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 68 </h2>
        <blockquote>
In days long since, before these last so bad.<br>
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<br>
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<br>
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,<br><br>
Before the golden tresses of the dead,<br>
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<br>
To live a second life on second head;<br>
Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:<br><br>
In him those holy antique hours are seen,<br>
Without all ornament, itself and true,<br>
Making no summer of another’s green,<br>
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;<br><br>
And him as for a map doth Nature store,<br>
To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>And so, his face is a map of times past – when beautiful people lived and died with the transience of flowers – before such illegitimate signs of beauty were created, or there was any thought of stamping them on the face of a living person; before the golden locks of dead bodies, which rightly belong in graves, were shorn to be made into wigs for living heads; before the beautiful fleece of dead people served to make living people happy. You can see those ancient times in his unadorned, naturally beautiful, face, which doesn’t capitalise on another’s glory, nor does he rob the old to adorn his beauty. Nature keeps him as a map to make a comparison between the cosmetic beauty of today and real beauty as it used to be.</p>
            
                    <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 69 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view<br>
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;<br>
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,<br>
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.<br><br>
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown’d;<br>
But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,<br>
In other accents do this praise confound<br>
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.<br><br>
They look into the beauty of thy mind,<br>
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;<br>
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,<br>
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:<br><br>
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,<br>
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Those parts of you that the world can see leave nothing to be desired. Everyone says so, granting you that without reservation. They’re only speaking the obvious truth – even your enemies agree. And so, your outward self is rewarded with public praise. But those very people who give that well deserved praise to your beauty change their tune when they look beyond the superficial. They examine the beauty of your mind and gain insight by taking note of your deeds. Then, although they’ve been kind about the beautiful fragrance of your looks, they churlishly insist on the rank smell of the weeds of your actions. So if your deeds don’t match your looks, this is the reason: that you’re surrounding yourself with common companions.</p>
            
                    <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 70 </h2>
        <blockquote>
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,<br>
For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair;<br>
The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br>
A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.<br><br>
So thou be good, slander doth but approve<br>
Thy worth the greater, being woo’d of time;<br>
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<br>
And thou present’st a pure unstained prime.<br><br>
Thou hast pass’d by the ambush of young days,<br>
Either not assail’d or victor being charged;<br>
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<br>
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:<br><br>
If some suspect of ill mask’d not thy show,<br>
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>That some people find fault with you won’t be counted as a defect, or a blot on your character, because those who are beautiful have always been the target of slanderous tongues. Suspicion always accompanies beauty – a crow taints the air of heaven by flying through it. If you could only remain good your critics would recognise that your worth is greater than they had thought, in that time has bestowed gifts on you, because vice, which is like a canker, often attacks the sweetest buds; and you present to the world a springtime of youth which is chaste and unsullied. You have bypassed the temptations of youth, either not having been attacked by temptation or by having been victorious when assaulted by it. Yet, this praise of you cannot forever be so powerful as to restrain envy, which is perpetually at liberty. If suspicion of sin did not cover your appearance you would reign supreme in love over multitudes of people.</p>
