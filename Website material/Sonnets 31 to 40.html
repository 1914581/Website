    <h1> Sonnets from 31 to 40</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 31 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,<br>
Which I by lacking have supposed dead;<br>
And there reigns Love, and all Love’s loving parts,<br>
And all those friends which I thought buried.<br><br>
How many a holy and obsequious tear<br>
Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,<br>
As interest of the dead, which now appear<br>
But things remov’d that hidden in thee lie!<br><br>
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<br>
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<br>
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,<br>
That due of many now is thine alone:<br><br>
Their images I lov’d, I view in thee,<br>
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Your heart has collected all the hearts which I, thinking them all dead, don’t have anymore. Love reigns in your heart – everything that love is, as well as all those friends whom I supposed to be dead and gone. How many tears of deep and devoted love I have shed for dead friends only to discover, now, that they are all just hiding in your heart. You’re the grave in which dead love springs back to life, adorned with trophies of my departed lovers, giving you all the love I once gave to them. All that love I owed them is now yours alone. I see the pictures of all those lovers in you; and you, who contain them all, have all of me.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 32 </h2>
        <blockquote>
If thou survive my well-contented day,<br>
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover<br>
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br>
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,<br><br>
Compare them with the bett’ring of the time,<br>
And though they be outstripped by every pen,<br>
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<br>
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br><br>
O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<br>
‘Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,<br>
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<br>
To march in ranks of better equipage:<br><br>
But since he died and poets better prove,<br>
Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love.’            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>If you survive me when my happy life is over and churlish death has covered my bones with dust, and you should by chance read again these poor, crude poems by your dead friend, compare them with the better poems that are being written these days. And though my poems are being outstripped by every other poet, keep them for love of me, not for their poetic quality, exceeded by the brilliant poems of better poets. So grant me just this one loving thought: “If my friend’s inspiration had been matched by the poetic excellence of the present time his love would have produced better poems than these, good enough to be ranked alongside those of today’s good poets. But since he died and poets are better now, I’ll read theirs for their style and his for his love.”</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 33 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br><br>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br><br>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br>
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br>
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br>
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br><br>
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br>
Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I’ve seen so many glorious mornings when the royal sun lights up the mountaintops, kisses the green meadows with its golden face, and makes streams shine with its celestial magic. But then it allows the blackest clouds to ride across its heavenly face with ugly gloom, and hides that face from the dull world, sneaking off to the west with the disgrace of it. In just that way my sun shone on my brow early one morning with that same triumphant splendor. But alas, he was mine for only one hour: the dark clouds have hidden him from me now. Yet, my love doesn’t condemn him in the least. The suns of humanity may show their faults if the sun of heaven does.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 34 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,<br>
And make me travel forth without my cloak,<br>
To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,<br>
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?<br><br>
‘Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br>
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<br>
For no man well of such a salve can speak,<br>
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:<br><br>
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;<br>
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:<br>
The offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief<br>
To him that bears the strong offence’s cross.<br><br>
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,<br>
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Why did you, like the sun, promise such a beautiful day and make me go out without my cloak then hide your brilliance behind the poisonous vapours of those nasty clouds, only to let them overtake me as I went? It’s not good enough to break through the clouds and dry the rain off my storm-beaten face because no-one can be satisfied with a balm that heals the wound but doesn’t cure the hurt. Nor can the shame you exhibit help: even though you’re repentant, I’m still bereft. An offender’s regret doesn’t give much relief to the one who has been badly offended. Ah, but those tears you’re shedding out of love are like pearls: they are very valuable and make up for all your bad deeds.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 35 </h2>
        <blockquote>
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:<br>
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:<br>
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<br>
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<br><br>
All men make faults, and even I in this,<br>
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<br>
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,<br>
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;<br><br>
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,<br>
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,<br>
And ‘gainst myself a lawful plea commence:<br>
Such civil war is in my love and hate,<br><br>
That I an accessary needs must be,<br>
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Stop worrying about what you did. Roses have thorns and silver fountains have mud; clouds and eclipses obscure both the moon and the sun, and loathsome diseases live in the sweetest buds. All people make mistakes, and even I am making one in writing this. In condoning your transgression by comparing it with other things I’m corrupting myself, making allowances for your misdeeds, giving more excuses for them than they warrant, because what I’m doing is using my rational mind to address what are only physical lapses on your part. The injured party is your defender and I’m now pleading your case against mine. My love and hate are so at war with each other that I can’t help being an accessory to that sweet thief who robs me every hour.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 36 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Let me confess that we two must be twain,<br>
Although our undivided loves are one:<br>
So shall those blots that do with me remain,<br>
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.<br><br>
In our two loves there is but one respect,<br>
Though in our lives a separable spite,<br>
Which though it alter not love’s sole effect,<br>
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.<br><br>
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<br>
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<br>
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<br>
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<br><br>
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br>
As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Let me admit that we two have to part even though we are united in love. By parting those disgraces that we’ve brought on ourselves can be born by me alone, without any help from you. In our love for each other there is a single mind, even though circumstances, which force us apart, can’t destroy our love, but rob us of those sweet hours of mutual pleasure. I can’t ever openly acknowledge you again because my wretched guilt would bring shame on you. Nor can you honour me with public notice without dishonouring yourself. So don’t do that: my love for you is such that I value your reputation as though it were my own.</p>
            
        <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 37 </h2>
        <blockquote>
As a decrepit father takes delight<br>
To see his active child do deeds of youth,<br>
So I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite,<br>
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;<br><br>
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,<br>
Or any of these all, or all, or more,<br>
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,<br>
I make my love engrafted to this store:<br><br>
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis’d,<br>
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give<br>
That I in thy abundance am suffic’d,<br>
And by a part of all thy glory live.<br><br>
Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:<br>
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>In the same way as a decrepit father delights in watching his energetic child’s youthful activities, I, who have been crippled by the spitefulness of fortune, take comfort in your qualities and fidelity. Because, whether beauty, rank, wealth, or intelligence, or any of those, or all of them, or any additional qualities, are your crowning glories, I’m attaching my love to them. By doing that I’m not lame, poor nor despised, as long as this illusion has enough substance to allow your good luck to satisfy me and let me live off some of your glory. Whatever you consider the best that’s what I wish for you. In having this wish I’m ten times lucky.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 38 </h2>
        <blockquote>
How can my muse want subject to invent,<br>
While thou dost breathe, that pour’st into my verse<br>
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent<br>
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br><br>
O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me<br>
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<br>
For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br>
When thou thy self dost give invention light?<br><br>
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<br>
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<br>
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br>
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<br><br>
If my slight muse do please these curious days,<br>
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How could I lack a subject to write my poems about while you are alive; you who pours your own sweet self – too excellent a subject for lesser poets to deal with – into my verse? Oh, give yourself the credit if anything of mine strikes you as being worth reading. For who is so inarticulate that he can’t write to you when you yourself provide the creative spark? You could be the tenth muse, worth ten times more than the usual nine invoked by poets. And let whoever calls on you write eternal verses that will outlive the ages. If my poor efforts please the demanding readers of these modern times the hard work of that will be mine but you will have the praise.</p>
            
        <br><hr><br>
    
        <h2> Sonnet 39 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! How thy worth with manners may I sing,<br>
When thou art all the better part of me?<br>
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?<br>
And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?<br><br>
Even for this, let us divided live,<br>
And our dear love lose name of single one,<br>
That by this separation I may give<br>
That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone.<br><br>
O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,<br>
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,<br>
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<br>
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,<br><br>
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<br>
By praising him here who doth hence remain.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>How can I proclaim your worth with due modesty when you are my better half? What could I get out of praising myself, and what else am I doing but praising myself when I praise you? For this reason we should part and our great love lose its common identity so that I can give you the praise that you deserve for yourself alone. Oh absence, what a torment you would be if it weren’t that the ill-intentioned leisure you give me allows me the pleasure of passing the time with thoughts of love, which makes it pass so swiftly. And that you teach me how to bring us together through my praising him here, while he remains elsewhere.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 40 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;<br>
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<br>
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;<br>
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.<br><br>
Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,<br>
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;<br>
But yet be blam’d, if thou thy self deceivest<br>
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.<br><br>
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,<br>
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:<br>
And yet, love knows it is a greater grief<br>
To bear love’s wrong, than hate’s known injury.<br><br>
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,<br>
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Take everything I love, my love; yes, take it all. What do you have then, that you didn’t have before? Not love that you could call true love, my love; all my love was already yours before you took this extra love from me. If you make love to another person instead of accepting my love I can’t blame you, love, because you’re just using my love. But still, you are to blame if you deceive yourself by taking from someone else what you won’t take from me. I forgive that robbery, dear thief, even though you’re stealing from someone so poor. And yet, everyone who loves knows that it’s more hurtful to be wounded by someone one loves than by an enemy. You – gracious and lascivious at the same time, in whom everything bad appears good – may kill me with hurtfulness, but we must not be enemies.</p>
