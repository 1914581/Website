    <h1> Sonnets from 11 to 20</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 11</h2>
        <blockquote>
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow’st<br>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<br>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,<br>
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.<br><br>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;<br>
Without this folly, age, and cold decay:<br>
If all were minded so, the times should cease<br>
And threescore year would make the world away.<br><br>
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br>
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br>
Look whom she best endow’d, she gave the more;<br>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br><br>
She carv’d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br>
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation...</strong>Your beauty would grow in a child of yours as rapidly as it fades in you, and when you are leaving your youth you could call that fresh blood that you give in your youth your own. Accepting this would be wise and it would ensure the preservation of your beauty; not doing so would be foolish and age would decay it. If everyone were to think like you it would result in the end of time and a sixty-year lifespan would bring the end of the world. Let those coarse, unremarkable, and crude people whom nature has not intended for breeding perish without issue. Whatever she gave to the best, she gave you more, and you should fully cherish those generous gifts. She printed her seal on you and by that meant that you should print more, not let that original die.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 12 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
And sable curls, all silvered o’er with white;<br><br>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br>
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves,<br>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br><br>
Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br>
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br>
And die as fast as they see others grow;<br><br>
And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defence<br>
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>When I count the chimes of the clock and watch the bright day sunken into terrifying night; when I see violets fading, and black curls all silvered over with white; when I see tall trees which previously offered shade to sheep and cattle but now with no leaves; and the green crops of summer tied up in harvested sheaves covered with scratchy dried out leaves, carried away on a wagon; then I begin to think about the endurance of your beauty and that you will have to decline and decay like everything else because sweet and beautiful things lose their sweetness and beauty and die while watching new sweet and beautiful things taking their place. The only defense against Time’s scythe is to defy him when he takes you away, by having children.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 13 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are<br>
No longer yours than you yourself here live:<br>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br><br>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
Find no determination: then you were<br>
Yourself again after yourself’s decease,<br>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br><br>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold<br>
Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day<br>
And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?<br><br>
O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know<br>
You had a father: let your son say so.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Oh, how I long for you to be yourself forever, unchanged, but, my love, you don’t have any identity for any longer than your time on earth. You should prepare yourself for this approaching end and pass your sweet likeness on to someone else. In that way, the lease that you hold for that beauty would not expire and you would survive after your self’s death, when your beautiful children would carry your beautiful form. Who allows such a lovely house to fall into decay when it could, with good management, be properly protected from the stormy winds of winter and the frustration of the eternal coldness of death? Oh, no-one except the irresponsible. My dear love, you once had a father: let your son be able to say the same thing.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 14 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;<br>
And yet methinks I have Astronomy,<br>
But not to tell of good or evil luck,<br>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality;<br><br>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<br>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
By oft predict that I in heaven find:<br><br>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
And, constant stars, in them I read such art<br>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,<br>
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert;<br><br>
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<br>
Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>I don’t pick my wisdom from the stars, but I think I understand astronomy, although not to predict good or bad luck, or plagues and famines or what the seasons will be like. Nor can I tell fortunes, showing individuals their own moods and their ups and downs, nor tell rulers whether things will go well by frequent predictions from what I see in the heavens. But I get my knowledge from your eyes, and as they are constant stars, I’m able to predict that truth and beauty will thrive together if you would turn your attention from yourself to the reproduction of yourself; otherwise, this is my prediction for you: your death will be the final end of truth and beauty.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 15 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When I consider every thing that grows<br>
Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br><br>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br>
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,<br>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br>
And wear their brave state out of memory;<br><br>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br>
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay<br>
To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br><br>
And all in war with Time for love of you,<br>
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>When I consider that every living thing holds its state of perfection for only a brief moment; that this huge stage, the world, presents only sham performances, which the stars secretly influence; when I realise that men grow like plants, encouraged and inhibited by the same weather, show off when flushed with youthful sap, then declining when full-grown, wearing away until their youth has been forgotten; then the consideration of this short, unpredictable life makes me see you as rich in youth in the face of the plans of Time and Decay to change your day of youth to dingy night. And, at war with Time because of my love for you, as he’s taking from you I’m renewing you in my poetry.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 16 </h2>
        <blockquote>
But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br>
And fortify your self in your decay<br>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br><br>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,<br>
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br><br>
So should the lines of life that life repair,<br>
Which this, Time’s pencil, or my pupil pen,<br>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br>
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br><br>
To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,<br>
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>But why don’t you use a more effective way of fighting this terrible tyrant, Time? And defend yourself with more effective methods than my useless poems? You are right at the peak of your life, and many maiden gardens, still unplanted, would love to bear you fresh young flowers much more like you than your portrait is. So your children, whose existence ensures your continuance, can give you perpetual life, something which neither Time’s paintbrush nor my poor pen can do. By giving yourself away you will preserve yourself, and so you will live, yourself being the artist who paints you.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 17 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Who will believe my verse in time to come,<br>
If it were fill’d with your most high deserts?<br>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.<br><br>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
The age to come would say ‘This poet lies;<br>
Such heavenly touches ne’er touch’d earthly faces.’<br><br>
So should my papers, yellow’d with their age,<br>
Be scorn’d, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
And your true rights be term’d a poet’s rage<br>
And stretched metre of an antique song:<br><br>
But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Who will believe my poem in times to come if it were filled with your great qualities? Heaven knows that it’s only like a grave that conceals your qualities, and doesn’t even show half your talents. Even if I had the ability to describe the beauty of your eyes, and write good lines that would enumerate all your gracious qualities, those who read it in the future would say ‘This poet is telling lies: no human face has ever possessed such heavenly beauty,’ so, my pages, yellowed with age, would be scorned like old men who talk nonsense, and the right that you have to such praise would be dismissed as a poet’s exaggeration – the elaborate metre of old-fashioned poems. But if there were a child of yours alive at that time, you would be doubly alive – in the child and in my poem.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 18 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br><br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;<br><br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br>
Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br><br>
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Shall I compare you to a summer’s day? You are more lovely and more moderate: Harsh winds disturb the delicate buds of May, and summer doesn’t last long enough. Sometimes the sun is too hot, and its golden face is often dimmed by clouds. All beautiful things eventually become less beautiful, either by the experiences of life or by the passing of time. But your eternal beauty won’t fade, nor lose any of its quality. And you will never die, as you will live on in my enduring poetry. As long as there are people still alive to read poems this sonnet will live, and you will live in it.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 19 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion’s paws,<br>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;<br>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,<br>
And burn the long-liv’d phoenix, in her blood;<br><br>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,<br>
And do whate’er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,<br>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;<br>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:<br><br>
O! carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,<br>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;<br>
Him in thy course untainted do allow<br>
For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.<br><br>
Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br>
My love shall in my verse ever live young.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Devouring Time, you may make the lion’s claws blunt and return all creatures to the earth from which they sprang; pull the teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws, and destroy the phoenix in her fire. Do whatever you like, fast-running Time, to any beautiful fading thing in the world; but I forbid you to commit one heinous crime: oh don’t cut into my love’s beautiful brow, nor draw wrinkles there with your insane pen. As you go on your destructive course spare him as a pattern of beauty for posterity. But, do your worst, old Time. Whatever harm you do my love will remain young forever in my poetry.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 20 </h2>
        <blockquote>
A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,<br>
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;<br>
A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted<br>
With shifting change, as is false women’s fashion:<br><br>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br>
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,<br>
Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.<br><br>
And for a woman wert thou first created;<br>
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br><br>
But since she prick’d thee out for women’s pleasure,<br>
Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explanation…</strong>Your face is more beautiful than a woman’s because it’s been painted by nature and not artificially. You are both master and mistress of my passion. You have the gentle heart of a woman but without the fickleness characteristic of women. Your eyes, that light up the very object that they look on, are brighter than theirs but without their shallow flirtatiousness. You have all the best qualities a man could have. All other men look to you as a model: you catch the eye of men and you amaze women. Nature first intended you as a woman, but as she was making you, she fell madly in love with you and, by adding something, deprived me of you; by adding one thing she made you unattainable to me. But since she equipped you for the pleasure of women, let me have your love and them your body.</p>
