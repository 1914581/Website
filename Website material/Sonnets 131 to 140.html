    <h1> Sonnets from 131 to 140</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 131 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,<br>
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;<br>
For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart<br>
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.<br><br>
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,<br>
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;<br>
To say they err I dare not be so bold,<br>
Although I swear it to myself alone.<br><br>
And to be sure that is not false I swear,<br>
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,<br>
One on another’s neck, do witness bear<br>
Thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place.<br><br>
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,<br>
And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>You are as tyrannous as those women whose beauty makes them proud and cruel, even though you look as you do, because you know full well that to my loving, doting heart, you are the most beautiful and most precious jewel. Yet, to be honest, some people, on seeing you, say that your face doesn’t have the power to make one groan with love. I wouldn’t be so bold as to tell them they’re mistaken, although I tell myself they are. And to make sure of that I groan a thousand groans just thinking about your face. Coming one after another my groans testify that in my opinion your dark complexion is most beautiful. There’s nothing dark about you, except your actions, and I think that’s why this slander about your looks continues.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 132 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,<br>
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,<br>
Have put on black and loving mourners be,<br>
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.<br><br>
And truly not the morning sun of heaven<br>
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,<br>
Nor that full star that ushers in the even,<br>
Doth half that glory to the sober west,<br><br>
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:<br>
O! let it then as well beseem thy heart<br>
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,<br>
And suit thy pity like in every part.<br><br>
Then will I swear beauty herself is black,<br>
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I love your eyes, and they, appearing to pity me, knowing that your heart torments me with scornfulness, look like mourners offering me polite sympathy on my bereavement. And honestly, the morning sun doesn’t become the grey eastern sky, nor the evening star the western twilight, half as much as those two mourning eyes become your face. Oh, let it also become your heart, then, to mourn for me, since mourning suits you so well in all your other parts. Then I’ll swear that beauty itself is dark and that all those who don’t have your complexion are ugly.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 133 </h2>
        <blockquote>
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!<br>
Is’t not enough to torture me alone,<br>
But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?<br>
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,<br><br>
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed:<br>
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;<br>
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed.<br>
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward,<br><br>
But then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail;<br>
Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;<br>
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:<br><br>
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,<br>
Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Damn that heart of yours that makes mine ache with the deep wound it gives both my friend and me! Isn’t it enough to torture me without subjecting my dearest friend to the same slavery? Your cruel eyes have unmanned me and enslaved my closest friend even more cruelly. So I’ve been abandoned by him, by myself, and by you, and such a frustration is a triple torment multiplied by three. Imprison my heart in the barred cell of your heart but allow it to bail my friend’s heart. No matter who guards me in my prison, let me be in charge of guarding him, then nothing you can do to me in my jail will be a torment to me. But you will still torment me because, being imprisoned in your heart, I belong to you, and everything that’s in my heart is yours.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 134 </h2>
        <blockquote>
So now I have confessed that he is thine,<br>
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,<br>
Myself I’ll forfeit, so that other mine<br>
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:<br><br>
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,<br>
For thou art covetous, and he is kind;<br>
He learned but surety-like to write for me,<br>
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.<br><br>
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,<br>
Thou usurer, that put’st forth all to use,<br>
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;<br>
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.<br><br>
Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:<br>
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>So now I’ve admitted that he’s yours, and that I’m still contracted to your desire, I’ll sacrifice myself if you’ll let my friend go so that he can comfort me. But you won’t; nor does he want his freedom, because you’re greedy and he’s soft-hearted. He tried to bail me out but that action has bound him to you as securely as I am. You’ll insist on the legal right your beauty entitles you to – you loan-shark, who lends your body to everyone, and then pursues my friend, who only borrowed from you for my sake! So I lose him because I abused him cruelly by allowing him to go to you. I’ve lost him: you’ve got both him and me. He repays both our debts with all the sex you want and yet I’m still not free.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 135 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br>
And Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;<br>
More than enough am I that vexed thee still,<br>
To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br><br>
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br>
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br>
Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br>
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br><br>
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br>
And in abundance addeth to his store;<br>
So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will<br>
One will of mine, to make thy large will more.<br><br>
Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<br>
Think all but one, and me in that one Will.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Whatever sexual fulfilment other women get, you have your Will, and another Will, too, and more will than you need. I, who never stop pestering you, would like to add myself to give you more than enough to satisfy your sweet vagina. Won’t you, with such a spacious vagina, allow me to hide my will in it just once? Are you going to let other men’s wills attract you but reject mine? The sea is full of water but continues to accept the rain and keeps adding it to its stock. So, like that, you are rich in having Wills. Add my will to the one you already have, stretching your spacious vagina even more. Don’t be so cruel as to kill a genuine petitioner. Think of all your lovers as one entity and accept me as a part of that one Will.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 136 </h2>
        <blockquote>
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,<br>
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,<br>
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;<br>
Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.<br><br>
Will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<br>
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<br>
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<br>
Among a number one is reckoned none:<br><br>
Then in the number let me pass untold,<br>
Though in thy store’s account I one must be;<br>
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<br>
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:<br><br>
Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br>
And then thou lovest me for my name is ‘Will’.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>If your conscience troubles you that I keep pestering you tell it that I’m your Will. Your conscience knows that my will is allowed to go there. Grant that much for the sake of love. Will will fill your sweet love treasure; oh yes, he’ll fill it full of wills and my will will be one of them. We know that one is never enough for things that can hold a lot. Therefore, let me be included among all the others: don’t count me, but value me nevertheless. Consider me as nothing as long as that nothing is sweet to you. Just love my name, and continue loving it, and then you’ll love me because my name is Will.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 137 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,<br>
That they behold, and see not what they see?<br>
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,<br>
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.<br><br>
If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,<br>
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,<br>
Why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks,<br>
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?<br><br>
Why should my heart think that a several plot,<br>
Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place?<br>
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,<br>
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?<br><br>
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,<br>
And to this false plague are they now transferred.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>You blind fool, Love, what are you doing to my eyes, that they look but don’t see what they’re looking at? They know what beauty is and where it is but mistake the worst for the best. If eyes, seduced by flirtatious glances, always dwell on a woman’s sexual charms, why have you forged a link between that misleading impression of the eyes and the judgment of my heart? Why should I think that she is my exclusive property when I know that she is every man’s? Or allow my eyes to deny it and think that such a foul lie is the truth? My heart and my eyes have mistaken falsehood for truth and are now owned by this deceitful woman.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 138 </h2>
        <blockquote>
When my love swears that she is made of truth<br>
I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>
That she might think me some untutor’d youth,<br>
Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.<br><br>
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>
Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:<br>
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress’d.<br><br>
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,<br>
And age in love loves not to have years told:<br><br>
Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<br>
And in our faults by lies we flatter’d be.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>When my mistress swears that she speaks nothing but the truth I believe her so that she will think that I’m a naïve youth, ignorant of the complex ways of the world – even though I know she’s lying. So, to satisfy my vanity, I believe that she regards me as young, even though she knows that my best days are behind me. I agree with her lies without reservation. And so we’re both concealing the truth from each other. But why does she insist on her lies? And why don’t I insist that I’m old? Oh, it’s best for lovers to pretend to trust each other; and older lovers don’t like having their age pointed out. So I lie with her and she lies with me, and both being imperfect, we flatter each other with our lies.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 139 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O! call not me to justify the wrong<br>
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;<br>
Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:<br>
Use power with power, and slay me not by art,<br><br>
Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere; but in my sight,<br>
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:<br>
What need’st thou wound with cunning, when thy might<br>
Is more than my o’erpressed defence can bide?<br><br>
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows<br>
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;<br>
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,<br>
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:<br><br>
Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,<br>
Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, don’t expect me to justify the heartache that your cruelty causes me. Don’t wound me with your eye; do it with your tongue. Use your power openly; don’t kill me with your clever tricks. Tell me you love someone else but please, sweetheart, when you’re with me control yourself from looking around at other men. Why do you need to hurt me with cunning when your power is already too much for me to cope with? Let me make excuses for you: Ah, my love knows very well that the way she looks at me can harm me, so she turns those looks on my enemies to kill them instead. And yet, don’t do that. Instead, as I’m almost dead, kill me outright with your looks and put me out of my misery.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 140 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press<br>
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;<br>
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express<br>
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.<br><br>
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,<br>
Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;<br>
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,<br>
No news but health from their physicians know;<br><br>
For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,<br>
And in my madness might speak ill of thee;<br>
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,<br>
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.<br><br>
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,<br>
Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Be as wise as you are cruel; don’t test my silent patience with too much disdain or my unhappiness may drive me to speak out, telling about your ruthlessness in hurting me. If you would allow me to advise you about an intelligent way of going about it, I would say it would be better to tell me you loved me even if you don’t, like a doctor who knows that it’s better to tell sensitive men who are near death that they are healthy. Because, if I start to despair I shall go mad, and in my madness I may speak ill of you. The faults of this world have become so bad that mad people believe the lies that mad people tell. To stop me from going mad and lying about you keep your eyes in place, even when your stubborn heart is wandering where it wants to.</p>
