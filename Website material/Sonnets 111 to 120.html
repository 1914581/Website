    <h1> Sonnets from 111 to 120</h1>
        <h2> Sonnet 111 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O, for my sake do you with fortune chide,<br>
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,<br>
That did not better for my life provide,<br>
Than public means which public manners breeds.<br><br>
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,<br>
And almost thence my nature is subdu’d<br>
To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:<br>
Pity me then and wish I were renew’d;<br><br>
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink<br>
Potions of eysell, ‘gainst my strong infection;<br>
No bitterness that I will bitter think,<br>
Nor double penance, to correct correction.<br><br>
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye<br>
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh, you’re cursing fortune – the cause of my bad behaviour – that didn’t provide better for my life than to make me perform in front of the public which was bound to influence my behaviour. That’s how I have come to have a bad name and it follows that my nature is affected by working with the public in the way a dyer’s hand is stained by working with dye. So with me, and I hope that I will be regenerated. In the meantime, like a willing patient, I will take better medicines for this strong infection. No matter how bitter it is I won’t think of it as bitter, nor will I complain about having to do double penance to correct this bad influence. Pity me, then, dear friend: I assure you that your pity is enough to cure me.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 112 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Your love and pity doth th’ impression fill<br>
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;<br>
For what care I who calls me well or ill,<br>
So you o’er green my bad, my good allow?<br><br>
You are my all the world, and I must strive<br>
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;<br>
None else to me, nor I to none alive,<br>
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.<br><br>
In so profound abysm I throw all care<br>
Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense<br>
To critic and to flatt’rer stopped are.<br>
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:<br><br>
You are so strongly in my purpose bred<br>
That all the world besides methinks y’are dead.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Your love and pity compensate for the gossip that’s branded me because what do I care about being called either good or bad as long as you ignore the bad things about me and acknowledge the things that are good? You’re all the world to me and I have to try and work out what’s good or bad about myself from the things you say. No-one else matters to me and I don’t matter to anyone alive so it’s entirely your opinion that determines what’s right or wrong. I have such a profound contempt for what others say that my sharp senses are cut off from both criticism and flattery. Notice how I don’t care that the world neglects me. You mean so much to me that everyone, apart from me, thinks you’re dead.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 113 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,<br>
And that which governs me to go about<br>
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,<br>
Seems seeing, but effectively is out;<br><br>
For it no form delivers to the heart<br>
Of bird, of flow’r, or shape which it doth latch.<br>
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,<br>
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;<br><br>
For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight,<br>
The most sweet favour or deformed’st creature,<br>
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night,<br>
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.<br><br>
Incapable of more, replete with you,<br>
My most true mind thus makes mine untrue.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Since I left you I’ve been preoccupied with my thoughts, and my eyes, that allow me to see what’s going on around me, function only partly, so that I’m half blind. I have some vision but it’s unfocused because it can’t define any form, such as birds, flowers or anything else it lands on. My mind can’t grasp anything my eyes show it, nor can my vision retain anything it captures. That’s because whatever it sees – the most crude or gentlest sight, the most sweetly-formed or the most deformed creature, the mountain or the sea, the day or the night, the crow or the dove – my vision shapes it to resemble you. Incapable of doing anything else, and filled with your image, my faithful mind makes me see everything unfaithfully.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 114 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,<br>
Drink up the monarch’s plague, this flattery?<br>
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,<br>
And that your love taught it this alchemy,<br><br>
To make of monsters and things indigest<br>
Such cheubins as your sweet self resemble,<br>
Creating every bad a perfect best<br>
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?<br><br>
O ’tis the first; ’tis flattery in my seeing,<br>
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up.<br>
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing,<br>
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.<br><br>
If it be poisoned, tis the lesser sin<br>
That mine eye loes it and doth first begin.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Or is it that my mind, crowned by you, has become the victim of flattery, that weakness of monarchs? Or could it be that my eyes are seeing accurately and that your love has given it this magical power of transforming monsters and other unappetising things into cherubs that resemble your sweet shape, turning everything unattractive into perfection as soon as it appears before my eyes? Oh, it’s the first one: flattery in my eyesight, and my mind drinks it up as a kings drinks up flattery. My eye knows what I likes to see and that’s the cup it prepares for me. If it’s a poisoned cup there’s no risk to me: my eye will taste it first.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 115 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,<br>
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:<br>
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why<br>
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.<br><br>
But reckoning Time, whose million’d accidents<br>
Creep in ‘twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,<br>
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents,<br>
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;<br><br>
Alas! why, fearing of Time’s tyranny,<br>
Might I not then say, ‘Now I love you best,’<br>
When I was certain o’er incertainty,<br>
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?<br><br>
Love is a babe, then might I not say so,<br>
To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>The sonnets that I have written lie, especially those that said I could not love you more deeply. When I wrote them my power of discernment didn’t know that I had yet to reach the heights of my creative fire. But ticking Time, whose millions of chance occurrences surreptitiously disrupt vows, make laws obsolete and turn exquisite beauty into ugliness, makes the sharpest of intentions blunt and diverts even the strongest minds to the demands of changing fashion. It’s sad: being aware of Time’s tyrannies, why should I not have said, ‘My love for you could never be greater than it is now,’ at a time when I was sure that my love was strong enough to overcome the uncertainties of time, believing the present to be the best it could be, and doubting that the future could bring better? Cupid is an infant, so surely I shouldn’t have said that something that is still growing was fully mature?</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 116 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove:<br><br>
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>
Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.<br><br>
Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
Within his bending sickle’s compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br><br>
If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.        
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I would not admit that anything could interfere with the union of two people who love each other. Love that alters with changing circumstances is not love, nor if it bends from its firm state when someone tries to destroy it. Oh no, it’s an eternally fixed point that watches storms but is never itself shaken by them. It is the star by which every lost ship can be guided: one can calculate it’s distance but not gauge its quality. Love doesn’t depend on Time, although the rosy lips and cheeks of youth eventually come within the compass of Time’s sickle. Love doesn’t alter as the days and weeks go by but endures until death. If I’m wrong about this then I’ve never written anything and no man has ever loved.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 117 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all<br>
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,<br>
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,<br>
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;<br><br>
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,<br>
And giv’n to time your own dear purchased right;<br>
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds<br>
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.<br><br>
Book both my willfulness and errors down,<br>
And on just proof surmise accumulate.<br>
Bring me within the level of your frown,<br>
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate,<br><br>
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove<br>
The constancy and virtue of your love.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Accuse me like this: that I’ve entirely neglected to repay what you so richly deserve; that I’ve forgotten to regard the great love you show me, even though I’m more and more in your debt every day; that I’ve spent most of my time with strangers, giving that time away when you have earned the right to it; that I’ve set my sails to all the winds that would blow me the furthest distance from you. Make a record of all the stubborn and mistaken things I’ve done and use the evidence to compile a long list. Look sternly at me but don’t give me the full force of the new hatred I’ve awakened in you because, in defence of myself, I claim that I was trying to test the constancy and quality of your love.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 118 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,<br>
With eager compounds we our palate urge,<br>
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,<br>
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;<br><br>
Even so, being full or your ne’er-cloying sweetness,<br>
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;<br>
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness<br>
To be diseas’d, ere that there was true needing.<br><br>
Thus policy in love, to anticipate<br>
The ills that were not, grew to faults assur’d,<br>
And brought to medicine a healthful state,<br>
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur’d;<br><br>
But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,<br>
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Just as we take pungent substances, and make ourselves throw up, to sharpen our appetites and prevent other illnesses, making ourselves sick by this urging, in the same way, being sated by your never-cloying sweetness, I changed my diet from that to more bitter food. And, tired of being so healthy, making myself a bit sick to avoid becoming really sick appealed to me. And so, using this love strategy – anticipating difficulties that didn’t exist – I got used to being unfaithful to you. I used medicine to remedy what was already a healthy relationship, trying to cure something good by applying evil to it. But I have learnt from that – and I think it was a good lesson – that the drugs I used after being so lovesick over you, are poisoning me.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 119 </h2>
        <blockquote>
What potions have I drunk of siren tears,<br>
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,<br>
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,<br>
Still losing when I saw myself to win!<br><br>
What wretched errors have my heart committed,<br>
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<br>
How have my eyes out of their sheres been fitted<br>
In the distraction of this maddening fever!<br><br>
O benefit of ill, now I find true<br>
That better is by evil still made better;<br>
And ruined love when it is built anew<br>
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater,<br><br>
So I return rebuked to my content,<br>
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>What seductive potions I have drunk – sweet but distilled in reality from substances foul as hell – applying doubt to my hopes and hope to my doubts, ever losing just as I think myself to be on the brink of victory! What wretched mistakes my heart made at a time when I felt I had never been so blessed! How my eyes have popped out of their sockets in the throes of this maddening fever! But oh, the benefits of evil! Now I can see it’s true that good things can be made better by evil and that ruined love can become even better when it’s rebuilt – stronger and far greater. And so I return, chastened, to the one who makes me happy and, because of the evils I’ve committed, I get back three times what I’ve spent.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 120 </h2>
        <blockquote>
That you were once unkind befriends me now,<br>
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,<br>
Needs must I under my transgression bow,<br>
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer’d steel.<br><br>
For if you were by my unkindness shaken,<br>
As I by yours, you’ve passed a hell of time;<br>
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken<br>
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.<br><br>
O! that our night of woe might have remembered<br>
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,<br>
And soon to you, as you to me, then tendered<br>
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!<br><br>
But that your trespass now becomes a fee;<br>
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>That you were once unfaithful to me is now a benefit and, unless my nerves were made of brass or beaten steel, I have to bow my head as an act of repentance for the sorrow that I felt, because if you were as upset by my cruelty as I was by yours, then your agonies have been like those of hell. And I, a tyrant, haven’t taken the time to think about the suffering I’ve undergone from your treatment of me. Oh, if only our period of black depression had reminded my innermost soul of how pitilessly real sorrow strikes I would quickly have offered you the healing ointment of love that mends the wounded heart, as you once quickly offered it to me! But your crime against me has now become a debt. My crime cancels your debt, and yours must cancel mine.</p>
