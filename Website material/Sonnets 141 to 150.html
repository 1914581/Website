        <h2> Sonnet 141 </h2>
        <blockquote>
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,<br>
For they in thee a thousand errors note;<br>
But ’tis my heart that loves what they despise,<br>
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.<br><br>
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted;<br>
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,<br>
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<br>
To any sensual feast with thee alone:<br><br>
But my five wits nor my five senses can<br>
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<br>
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,<br>
Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be:<br><br>
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,<br>
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>No, really, it isn’t with my eyes that I love you, because they record a thousand flaws in you. Instead, it’s my heart that loves what my eyes despise and dotes on you in spite of what you look like. Nor are my ears delighted by the sound of your voice. Nor do I long to touch you sexually. Nor do my senses of taste and smell wish to be invited to any sensual feast in which you are the only item on the menu. But all my mental faculties and my five senses can’t persuade my foolish heart not to serve you; they leave me looking like a man but without the free will of a man, reduced to being the slave and property of your proud heart. The only thing I gain from being plagued like this is that the one who is making me sin rewards me with pain.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 142 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,<br>
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:<br>
O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,<br>
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;<br><br>
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,<br>
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments<br>
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,<br>
Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.<br><br>
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov’st those<br>
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:<br>
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,<br>
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<br><br>
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<br>
By self-example mayst thou be denied!            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Loving you is my sin, and your best virtue is hatred: hatred of my sin, based on your own illicit loving. But oh, compare your own position with mine and you will find that I don’t deserve to be reprimanded, or if I do, not from your lips, that have given as many sinful kisses and made as many false promises as mine have. We have both cheated in our marriages. If it’s fair for me to love you as much as you love those you lust after, while I lust after you, allow pity to be rooted in your heart so that when it grows you’ll also deserve to be pitied. If you expect to carry on with your illicit affairs and be pitied at the same time, you may be denied because of the example you are setting.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 143 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch<br>
One of her feather’d creatures broke away,<br>
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch<br>
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;<br><br>
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<br>
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent<br>
To follow that which flies before her face,<br>
Not prizing her poor infant’s discontent;<br><br>
So runn’st thou after that which flies from thee,<br>
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;<br>
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,<br>
And play the mother’s part, kiss me, be kind;<br><br>
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy ‘Will’,<br>
If thou turn back and my loud crying still.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>See: like a conscientious housewife, running to catch one of her chickens that has broken free, setting down her baby and hurrying in pursuit of the creature she’s trying to catch; while her neglected child chases after her, cries in its efforts to catch up with her, while her preoccupation is with that thing that’s running away from her, and not caring about the poor infant’s distress – in the same way, you are running after the one who’s fleeing from you, while I, your baby, chasing you, am left far behind. But if you catch the one you’re after, turn back to me and be a good mother. Kiss me; be kind. I’ll pray that you will get your Will as long as you turn back and stop my loud crying.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 144 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,<br>
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:<br>
The better angel is a man right fair,<br>
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.<br><br>
To win me soon to hell, my female evil,<br>
Tempteth my better angel from my side,<br>
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,<br>
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.<br><br>
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,<br>
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;<br>
But being both from me, both to each friend,<br>
I guess one angel in another’s hell:<br><br>
Yet this shall I ne’er know, but live in doubt,<br>
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>I love two people: one brings me comfort, the other despair. Like two angels, they’re always suggesting things to me. The good angel is a fair-haired man; the bad one is a dark complexioned woman. To take me swiftly into hell, my evil female tempts my good angel away from me, trying to turn him into a devil, corrupting him with her evil self-assurance. And whether that angel has indeed turned into a fiend is something I suspect but can’t be sure about. But since they are both away from me and friends with each other I’m guessing that one angel is inside the other’s hell. I’ll never know, though, and I’ll live in doubt until my bad angel shoots my good one out of hell.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 145 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Those lips that Love’s own hand did make,<br>
Breathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate’,<br>
To me that languished for her sake:<br>
But when she saw my woeful state,<br><br>
Straight in her heart did mercy come,<br>
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet<br>
Was used in giving gentle doom;<br>
And taught it thus anew to greet;<br><br>
‘I hate’ she altered with an end,<br>
That followed it as gentle day,<br>
Doth follow night, who like a fiend<br>
From heaven to hell is flown away.<br><br>
‘I hate’, from hate away she threw,<br>
And saved my life, saying ‘not you’.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Those lips, shaped by the goddess of love herself, breathed the words ‘I hate.’ To me! The man pining away for love of her! But when she saw the unhappy state I was in, her heart was immediately filled with pity and she checked the tongue that always used to treat me gently. She made it say something different. She changed what she was saying by adding a few words to ‘I hate’, making it seem a natural progression, in the way that the gentle day follows the night, chasing the fiend back to hell. She removed the hatred from the words ‘I hate’ and saved my life by adding ‘not you’.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 146 </h2>
        <blockquote>
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,<br>
Thrall to these rebel powers that thee array,<br>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<br>
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br><br>
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br>
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br>
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body’s end?<br><br>
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant’s loss,<br>
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br>
Within be fed, without be rich no more:<br><br>
So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<br>
And Death once dead, there’s no more dying then.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Poor soul, right at the centre of your sinful body, slave to its rebellious worldliness, ever attacking you. Why do you dwindle away inside, suffering starvation, while decorating your outside walls with such expensive paint? Why such expenditure when the lease on your crumbling mansion is so short? Are you doing it so that worms can inherit this excess and eat up what you’ve spent? Is that the purpose of your body? Instead, live on by starving your body and let it dwindle away while you enrich yourself. Gain spiritual wealth by discarding worthless worldly things. Feed the inner self and allow your body to be poor. In that way you’ll eat up death, that feeds on men, and once death is dead there will be no more dying.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 147 </h2>
        <blockquote>
My love is as a fever longing still,<br>
For that which longer nurseth the disease;<br>
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,<br>
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.<br><br>
My reason, the physician to my love,<br>
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,<br>
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve<br>
Desire is death, which physic did except.<br><br>
Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,<br>
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;<br>
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen’s are,<br>
At random from the truth vainly expressed;<br><br>
For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,<br>
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>My love is like a fever, still constantly desiring the thing that caused the illness; feeding on the thing that prolongs it, to please the unhealthy appetite of my body. My reason, the doctor of my love, angry that I’m not following his directions, has abandoned me and now I find that I’m dying from the desire that his medicine would have cured. I’m past cure now, and my reason doesn’t care, and I’m frantic with increasing worry. My thoughts and words are like a madman’s, randomly expressing nonsense; because I have insisted that you are good, and bright as day, whereas you are as black as hell and dark as night.</p>

        <h2> Sonnet 148 </h2>
        <blockquote>
O me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,<br>
Which have no correspondence with true sight;<br>
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,<br>
That censures falsely what they see aright?<br><br>
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,<br>
What means the world to say it is not so?<br>
If it be not, then love doth well denote<br>
Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s: no,<br><br>
How can it? O! how can Love’s eye be true,<br>
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?<br>
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;<br>
The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.<br><br>
O cunning Love! with tears thou keep’st me blind,<br>
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh me! What eyes Love has put into my head, that fail to see things undistorted! Or if they can see things accurately, what’s happened to my judgment, that falsely criticises what they see? If the one my flawed eyes see as beautiful is beautiful, what does everyone else mean when they say she isn’t? If she isn’t it shows that when one is in love the eyes don’t see as clearly as other eyes do. No, how could they? Oh, how could the eyes of love see accurately when they’re so distraught by staying awake and crying? It’s no wonder, then, that I’m mistaken in what I see; the sun itself doesn’t see anything until the sky clears. Oh, my cunning love! You keep me blind with tears so that, not seeing clearly, I can’t discover your bad faults.</p>

        <blockquote>
Canst thou, O cruel! Say I love thee not,<br>
When I against myself with thee partake?<br>
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot<br>
Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?<br><br>
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,<br>
On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon,<br>
Nay, if thou lour’st on me, do I not spend<br>
Revenge upon myself with present moan?<br><br>
What merit do I in my self respect,<br>
That is so proud thy service to despise,<br>
When all my best doth worship thy defect,<br>
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?<br><br>
But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,<br>
Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Can you, oh cruel woman, say that I don’t love you when I take your side against myself? Don’t I think about you and forget about myself, you tyrant? Who dislikes you that I would call my friend? Who do you dislike who I like? Yes, if you scowl at me don’t I take immediate revenge on myself by moaning in pain? What quality do I see in myself that would make me too proud to serve you when the best in me worships your defects, commanded as I am by the merest flickering of your eyes? But carry on hating me, my love, because I know your mind now. You love those who can see, and I am blind!</p>

        <blockquote>
O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,<br>
With insufficiency my heart to sway?<br>
To make me give the lie to my true sight,<br>
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?<br><br>
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,<br>
That in the very refuse of thy deeds<br>
There is such strength and warrantise of skill,<br>
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?<br><br>
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,<br>
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?<br>
O! though I love what others do abhor,<br>
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:<br><br>
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,<br>
More worthy I to be beloved of thee.            
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Explantion...</strong>Oh! where did you find this incredible power to control my heart in spite of your inadequacy? To make me disbelieve what my eyes see, making me swear that daylight isn’t bright? Where did you get this skill to make bad things look so good in you that even your most unworthy actions make my mind think that your worst is better than everyone else’s best? Who taught you how to make me love you more, the more I hear and see good reasons to hate you? Oh! even though I love what others hate you shouldn’t join them in despising me for loving you. I deserve to be loved by you because it was your unworthiness that made me love you.</p>
